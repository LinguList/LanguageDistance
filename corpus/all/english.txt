 Clientelism Versus Social Learning: The Electoral Effects of International Migration 
 Tobias Pfutze is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Oberlin College in Ohio. Most of his research focuses on Political Economy and Public Policy issues in Mexico and other Latin American countries. 
 Abstract 
 Most research on the effects of international migration on democratic institutions in sending countries focuses on how emigration changes the civic and democratic values of those left behind. Little attention has been given to how the additional income provided by migrant remittances alters the incentive structure of the political actors involved and how this will affect political outcomes. This paper develops a voting model that accounts for the effect of higher income through remittances and shows that its expected effects on voter turnout patterns differ in important ways from those of improved civic values. Taking these predictions to the data, it is shown that, for the case of Mexican municipal elections over the year  –  period, the empirical evidence strongly supports the notion that international remittances had a positive effect on electoral competitiveness in Mexico by reducing the clientelistic power of the formerly dominant state party (Institutional Revolutionary Party). This result is robust to the use of instrumental variables.

Public Banking &
Economic Democracy
by Gwendolyn Hallsmith
Public banks can
be used to catalyze
real change that is
needed to transform the money
used to drive the
economy.
Page  
rivate banks have not always been accepted
institutions, fixtures of commerce, and purveyors of most of our economic transactions.
Throughout US history, there have been robust
public conversations about banks, largely due to
their propensity to derail the economy when their
business models fail. One example of this was in
rural Vermont in  , when the state established
their first public bank. Testimony on that bill,
from Governor Tichenor lays out the problem:
 Banks, by facilitating enterprises both hazardous
and unjustifiable, are natural sources of all that class
of vices which arise from the gambling system and
which cannot fail to act as sure and fatal, though
slow, poisons to the republic in which they exist.
 The current public banking discussion revives
this tradition after   years of a private central
banking model that has failed us. Private banks are
behind the rapidly growing disparity between the
rich and the poor, due to their need for a boom and
bust, bubble-making “growth” economy, which
drives impoverishment and ecological devastation.
 Income inequality in the US is the highest it
has been since   and has grown exponentially
over the last   years. The concentrating force of
the debt-based banking system used to be offset
by progressive taxation, but with its demise in the
Reagan years, the systemic extraction of wealth
from nature and people, which is transferred to
those at the top, has gone unchecked.
 Ecologically, we are now in the midst of a
human-made species extinction larger than any
other in Earth’s history. Climate change threatens
our food supply, as areas of drought and flooding
change rapidly. The “growth” economy demands
ever-increasing production and consumption to
fuel the insatiable appetite of the money system.
 An economic operating system that has these
problematic side effects would not be chosen
knowingly by the worlds population. People
everywhere recognize that we need a healthy environment. People would not support rampant poverty either, if we only had a choice in the matter.
 The Earth Charter Commission undertook
something like a global poll about the principles
we needed to adopt if we are to have any hope of
peace and sustainability. The result was the Earth
Charter, an internationally adopted document
that outlines an ethical manifesto for our future.
It recognized the inherent linkages between social
justice and environmental health, which demand
democratic governance and a deep sense of
graphic: Steve Breen
respect and care for the whole community of life.
 Public banking, which focuses on a transfer
of taxpayer deposits into public control, for public benefit, is the engine of a more democratic
economy. In Vermont this past month,   cities
and towns voted to direct the state legislature to
create a Public Bank. In Pennsylvania, the City of
Reading is establishing a public bank, and
Philadelphia is not far behind. Senator Elizabeth
Warren just endorsed the idea of post office
banks. Other variations include land banks in
Ohio, Green Banks in New York, plus traditional
public finance options from Community
Development Corporations for local and regional
economic development to state lending agencies
designed to offset market gaps for business,
home, student, and municipal finance.
 Creating public banks can be the democratic
camel’s nose under the tent of the privatized monetary system. We start with public control of public
money – creating banks where deposits of taxpayer
dollars are used to finance economic development,
education, and infrastructure. Over the long term,
these public banks can be used to catalyze real
change that is needed to transform the money used
to drive the economy. Public banks on their own do
not accomplish this, they merely transfer profits
made by economic development lending from the
private banks to the public coffers. Public banks
can, however, set up systems where a public monetary utility could be established, where Time Banks
and commercial barter systems can be facilitated,
and their units leveraged for tax payments.
 Democracy works when all constituents feel they
have a voice in the decisions that affect their lives; it
fails when people believe their voices are overpowered
by others. Corporate personhood, corporate media,
and widespread economic inequality have hijacked
our democracy. We need to reassert democratic control over the creation and circulation of money to
restore the values of democracy our heritage
demands. Public banking can help us do this, especially with the recognition that it is one step in building economic democracy through monetary reform.

 “Dost thou think, because thou art virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?” 
 Constitutional conventions: best practice 
 The current financial system is part of the problem, not part of the solution. So what’s to be done? 
 The debate about the banks power to create money is becoming much more mainstream. After the recent event, Does Money Grow on Trees?, parliament is scheduled to debate the issue for the first time in   years. 
 If banks wont pull investment from fossil fuels, perhaps its time to try another route. 
 Marc Bauders Master of the Universe runs like a sociological narrative of high finance as experienced by one man, former investment banker Rainer Voss. Film review. 
 We cannot rely on failed regulators to prevent banks from abusing the power to create money, as Ann Pettifor suggests . 
 In this exclusive extract from Just Money: How Society Can Break the Despotic Power of Finance Ann Pettifor describes how orthodox economics and finance have promoted a profoundly inadequate account of money. Change is necessary and possible. But it will come only through a revolution in the general public’s understanding. 
 Finance has cast a spell on the framework for international economic co-operation established after the Second World War. The  -  crisis and its aftermath highlight the need to rouse the IMF and the World Bank from their slumbers. 
 Persistent trade imbalances are threatening to derail the European economy. Luca Fantacci calls for a European Clearing Union to promote a sustainable pattern of production and consumption across the Eurozone. 
 “Financial repression” always casts state regulators as authoritarian villains and allows apologists for uncontrolled finance to pose as freedom fighters. Maybe we should worry far less about efforts to “repress” finance and far more about finance’s efforts to oppress the rest of us. 
 The growth of finance over the last forty years has changed capitalism profoundly. It is time for its critics to grasp the nature and significance of these changes. Only then will the supremacy of finance face an effective challenge. 
 The shadow banking sector is now integral to the global financial system. Its architects are constantly seeking to evade oversight and control through the use of offshore accounting and forbidding complexity. The regulatory reforms that followed the  -  crisis are bound to be tested. 
 The debate between these two economists on the role of banking and specifically the creation of credit is of fundamental importance in understanding the shortcomings of orthodox economic thinking - and why it was so ill-equipped to handle, let alone predict, the crash of  . 
 Money is currently produced by a ‘public-private partnership’ between the state and the financial sector, a partnership whose nature remains obscure to the great majority of the population. Is another distribution of knowledge – and hence of power – possible? This, argues, Geoffrey Ingham, remains the crucial question for socialists. 
 It is now   years since the banking crash but its effects are still with us. What exactly happened, what has the world done about it, and is there anything to stop something similar happening again? 
 Finance and the British state are mutually embedded to the point that it can be hard to tell where one stops and the other starts. Here, Tamasin Cave of Spinwatch gives us a brief tour of the tangled web that is public life in the UK. 
 The power of the financial sector in Britain has worked a transformation on the country’s ‘common sense’.  A successful challenge will require a radical change to the language we use to describe our shared life. 
 Is finance like crude oil? Countries rich in minerals are often poverty-stricken, corrupt and violent. A relatively small rent-seeking elite captures vast wealth while the dominant sector crowds out the rest of the economy. The parallels with countries ‘blessed’ with powerful financial sectors are becoming too obvious to ignore.

 Banking on Democracy 
 Overview 
 Politics matter for financial markets and financial markets matter for politics, and nowhere is this relationship more apparent than in emerging markets. In Banking on Democracy , Javier Santiso investigates the links between politics and finance in countries that have recently experienced both economic and democratic transitions. He focuses on elections, investigating whether there is a “democratic premium”—whether financial markets and investors tend to react positively to elections in emerging markets. 
 Santiso devotes special attention to Latin America, where over the last three decades many countries became democracies, with regular elections, just as they also became open economies dependent on foreign capital and dominated bond markets. Santiso’s analysis draws on a unique set of primary databases (developed during his years at the OECD Development Centre) covering an entire decade: more than  ,  bank and fund manager portfolio recommendations on emerging markets. 
 Santiso examines the trajectory of Brazil, for example, through its presidential elections of  ,  , and   and finds a decoupling of financial and political cycles that occurred also in many other emerging economies. He charts this evolution through the behavior of brokers, analysts, fund managers, and bankers. Ironically, Santiso points out, while some emerging markets have decoupled politics and finance, in the wake of the  –  financial crisis many developed economies (Europe and the United States) have experienced a recoupling between finance and politics.

 Reviews 
 “ Banking on Democracy is a must read for policy makers and practitioners alike as well as excellent reading for anyone interested in politics, elections, and Latin America.”— Société Universitaire Européenne de Recherches Financières 
 Endorsements 
 “Elections inevitably impact financial markets, particularly in regions such as Latin America where the rise of democracy has coincided with economic liberalization. In this timely study, Santiso illustrates the complex interaction of politics and financial decision making in emerging markets, a topic that is vital in the quest for stable and sustainable economic growth.” — Luis Alberto Moreno , President, Inter-American Development Bank 
 “ Banking on Democracy explores a topic of increasing importance to a broad audience. The question is timeless—do democracies pay a premium to borrow on global financial markets? Javier Santiso answers the question masterfully, drawing on a wide array of financial market indicators, original micro-level evidence, and informative case studies. This is one of the few books that takes the lessons learned in industrial countries and applies them to emerging market economies. It is a must-read for students and practitioners alike.” — David Leblang , J. Wilson Newman Professor of Governance, Professor of Politics, University of Virginia 
 “This is a profoundly interesting exploration of the relation between democracy and financial markets in emerging markets. An essential reading for anyone interested in politics, elections, and Latin America.” — Laura Alfaro , Warren Alpert Professor of Business Administration, Harvard Business School 
 “ Banking on Democracy brings together two dynamite elements: politics and financial markets. The interaction of both, while critical to the economic success of emerging markets, until recently, has not been well understood. Santiso delivers a fine and insightful analysis of how these intricate forces interact and the consequences. A must-read!” — Marcelo Claure , Chairman & CEO, Brightstar Corp.

Bled, Slovenia  May  
Wall Street and the City are starting to take a fresh look at emerging
markets. During the  s, financial and economic variables dominated
their analysis. Over the  s, political and ethical variables are
increasingly growing in relevance.
In   Rexiter Capital Management, a UK based asset maneger, launched
the world’s first “sustainability” investment strategy exclusively focused
on emerging markets.
Previously, Calpers - a major US pension fund with nearly USD   billion
of assets under, which started to invest in emerging markets by the
beginning of the  s – also started to consider non-financial criteria
such as political stability, transparency and labour rights.
Bankers also started to increasingly take into account other variables to
assess their investment decisions around the world.
In  , a leading group of top global bankers launched the Equator
Principles, an initiative led by   of the world’s largest banks to address
the social and environmental impact of the projects that they finance.
Political issues such as human rights seem to be now on their radar
screens. But what about democracy ? What about political regimes? Are
they taken into account by banks when they decide to invest or not in a
country? Put in another way, do banks have political preferences?

Banks and Policy Stability.
Banking on Demorcacy: Politics Matters
Institutional and political environment influence international capital
transactions.
Institutional quality is the most important variable explainging Lucas’
Paradox (Alfaro et al.,   and  ).
FDI in particular is sensitive to politics. Countries with weaker democratic
rights tend to attract less US FDI capital (Rodrik,  ). FDI private
investors significantly increased their investments in the three years
following the shift to democratic rule (Pei and Lyon,  ).
Investments made by multinationals are higher in democratic countries in
terms of FDI per capita (Harms and Ursprung,  , Busse,  ).
Politics Matters
Regarding banks, politics and institutions are also key determinants of
international banking activities (Papaioannou,  ): a fall of five
percent in the political risk of the recipient country is accompanied by
a two percent rise in the volume of bilateral bank lending.
The claims of US, Spanish and Italian banks tend to be sensitive to
transaction costs (i.e. informational costs) but also to the role of
government intervention in the financial sector as well as country risk,
which includes not only economic and financial variables but also
political factors (García-Herrero and Martínez-Peria,  ).
All in all, banks tend to invest in countries with high-quality
institutions and allocate credit to countries that are not characterised
by corruption, and which have efficient legal systems.
Two synchronized trends
Over the past decade, foreign bank claims took off as part of the
process of greater financial integration and the opening up of
emerging countries to capital flows
Among emerging countries, Latin America and Eastern Europe
experienced the biggest increase, rising by more than  % and
 % respectively.
In both areas democratization has been particularly intensive.

 Big Pharma caught spying on the WHO 
 From WikiLeaks 
 By Kaitlin Mara ( Intellectual Property Watch ) [ ] 
 Confidential documents related to the World Health Organization Expert Working Group on innovative financing for research and development surfaced today, revealing the group’s thinking as well as pharmaceutical industry thinking about the WHO process. The documents immediately raised concern about possible undue access to the process by industry; the WHO told Intellectual Property Watch the industry group was not supposed to have the documents. 
 The documents appear to have come from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), and include draft reports on innovative financing mechanisms from the working group as well as an analysis by the IFPMA on the reports’ contents. They were released on Wikileaks, a website that anonymously publishes sensitive documents. 
 ”IFPMA was not supposed to have working drafts of the expert working group in their possession and they were not given these documents,” said Precious Matsoso, director of Public Health Innovation and Intellectual Property (PHI) at the WHO, under whose auspices the expert working group falls. “It was understood by the working group that its report is intended for the director general and” WHO members, she added. 
 Public health advocates reacted strongly to the leaked documents. “The IFPMA document confirms much of what had been feared,” that there is “a larger WHO strategy to protect the status quo, particularly as it relates to intellectual property issues,” said James Love, the director of Knowledge Ecology International, a non-profit group focussed on transparency in policymaking and which has been advocating for prize funds, a biomedical R&D treaty, and other initiatives to fund R&D. 
 An introductory letter included with the documents addressed to the Public Health Advocacy Committee at IFPMA says “the overall result [of the working group’s report] is in line with most of the industry positions on this matter,” but says that “there is still room for them to introduce new language” as the documents date from before the final working group meeting concluded on   December. 
 The Expert Working Group’s “comparative analysis of innovative financing proposals for health R&D,” available from Wikileaks here [pdf], divides aspects of drug development into six categories and then lists the ideas from “least likely” to “most likely” to work. 
 The six categories are: fundraising, research and development capacity building in developing countries, basic research and product discovery, product development, manufacturing and distribution, and efficiencies. 
 The draft reports available on Wikileaks do not contain final recommendations. These will be available only in the final report, expected to be released this week ( IPW, WHO,   December   ). Instead, it contains an analysis of all proposals made thus far, through two calls for advice from the public, and ranks them on efficacy and feasibility. 
 Within “fundraising,” proposals considered “least likely to work” include diverting existing resources to health, reducing tax evasion and havens, levying new charges on services or access rights. A proposal for a “Green IP” system ( IPW, Inside Views,   June   ) is currently “too hard to operationalise” but some elements could potentially be useful. 
 Most likely to work include new indirect taxes, for example on internet users; voluntary private contributions, new donor funds, and taxes on pharmaceutical profits. Taxing pharmaceutical profits is estimated to generate only USD   million versus, for example, a potential USD   billion from internet taxes. 
 On building research capacity, specific recommendations are not made, but the report says there is a lot of potential in this idea as innovative pharmaceutical development is often done in commercial ventures and, in developing countries, “commercial targets often have significant overlap with public health targets,” as local markets demand treatment for neglected diseases. 
 On basic research, prize systems and prize funds for completed drugs, as well as a “health impact fund,” are deemed least effective, as is the idea of a biomedical R&D treaty. “Endstage prizes” and the treaty were also seen as not particularly beneficial for product development. Prizes have been advocated as a solution to R&D financing problems by several health advocacy NGOs ( IPW, Public Health,   February   ). 
 Deemed more effective in incentivising research were funding for product development partnerships, grants to companies working on neglected diseases, and prizes for reaching “milestones” (such as those provided by Innocentive). Similar incentives were considered beneficial for product development. 
 Prizes were seen as possible incentives for manufacturing and distribution, though “likely only for diagnostics” as opposed to vaccines or medicines. 
 “Absolutely Fair Towards the Industry” 
 The draft report, the IFPMA said, is “absolutely fair” regarding industry concerns, using “real figures” on the cost of drug and vaccines developments and containing “many references to the importance of intellectual property … to achieve further innovation.” 
 As far as streamlining the current R&D system, which the report calls “unwieldy,” removing data exclusivity was seen as less effective compared to harmonising medicine regulatory systems and “pre-competitive platforms” for R&D. 
 The IFPMA analysis raised two major concerns. 
 The first relates to proposed taxes on the pharmaceutical industry, which the IFPMA document says “places the burden of the R&D … exclusively on industry and reinforces the negative image of pharmaceutical profits.” 
 “Operationalising this proposal may lead to companies increasing prices to compensate which would be counterproductive,” it adds. Further, it is not certain to be acceptable by all partners “as the tax should be imposed on the whole pharmaceutical sector, generic included.” 
 The second area of concern is drug-purchasing mechanism UNITAID’s proposed patent pool, and in particular its structure for royalty payments to IP owners. These payments would be determined based on the “therapeutic benefits and the affordability of royalities in particular countries,” the analysis says, adding that this “does not follow past or current patent pool structures” and emphasising that voluntary participation should be an “essential prerequisite.” 
 A UNITAID board meeting on  -  December will review an expert study on the patent pool, which the UNITAID board agreed in principle to establish in July  . In May  , the board instructed the organisation’s secretariat to prepare an implementation plan. An expert team analysed a range of issues and its report, completed in November, clearly recommends the implementation of the pool, sources told Intellectual Property Watch. 
 The IFPMA analysis also called for vigilance regarding the potential use of open source systems. 
 NGOs: Documents “A Step Backwards” 
 Love said the expert working group process was “a step backwards” and “evidence of a deeper problem in WHO regarding the influence of the pharmaceutical industry, and its philanthropic supporter, the Microsoft founder’s Gates Foundation.” 
 ”This is a very disturbing set of documents,” said Sarah Rimmington, from nongovernmental organization Essential Action’s Access to Medicines Project. She added that the report “embraces the status quo and rejects the feasibility of almost every single important proposal aimed at truly solving these complicated problems.”

 Democratization 
 Democratization is the transition to a more democratic political regime . It may be the transition from an authoritarian regime to a full democracy , a transition from an authoritarian political system to a semi-democracy or transition from a semi-authoritarian political system to a democratic political system. The outcome may be consolidated (as it was for example in the United Kingdom ) or democratization may face frequent reversals (as it has faced for example in Argentina ). Different patterns of democratization are often used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows. Democratization itself is influenced by various factors, including economic development, history, and civil society. The ideal result from democratization is to ensure that the people have the right to vote and have a voice in their political system. 
 There is considerable debate about the factors which affect or ultimately limit democratization. A great many things, including economics, culture, and history, have been cited as impacting on the process. Some of the more frequently mentioned factors are: 
 Wealth . A higher GDP/capita correlates with democracy and some claim the wealthiest democracies have never been observed to fall into authoritarianism. [ ] The rise of Hitler and of the Nazis in Weimar Germany can be seen as an obvious counter-example, but although in early  s Germany was already an advanced economy, by that time, the country was also living in a state of economic crisis virtually since the World War I (in the  s), a crisis which was eventually worsened by the effects of the Great Depression. There is also the general observation that democracy was very rare before the industrial revolution. Empirical research thus lead many to believe that economic development either increases chances for a transition to democracy ( modernization theory ), or helps newly established democracies consolidate. [ ] [ ] One study finds that economic development prompts democratization but only in the medium run ( –  years). This is because development may entrench the incumbent leader but make it more difficult for him deliver the state to a son or trusted aide when he exits. [ ] However, the debate about whether democracy is a consequence of wealth, a cause of it, or both processes are unrelated, is far from conclusion. [ ] Another study suggests that economic development depends on the political stability of a country to promote democracy. [ ] 
 Social equality . Acemoglu and Robinson argued that the relationship between social equality and democratic transition is complicated: People have less incentive to revolt in an egalitarian society (for example, Singapore ), so the likelihood of democratization is lower. In a highly unequal society (for example, South Africa under Apartheid ), the redistribution of wealth and power in a democracy would be so harmful to elites that these would do everything to prevent democratization. Democratization is more likely to emerge somewhere in the middle, in the countries, whose elites offer concessions because ( ) they consider the threat of a revolution credible and ( ) the cost of the concessions is not too high. [ ] This expectation is in line with the empirical research showing that democracy is more stable in egalitarian societies. [ ] 
 Culture . It is claimed by some that certain cultures are simply more conductive to democratic values than others. This view is likely to be ethnocentric . Typically, it is Western culture which is cited as "best suited" to democracy, with other cultures portrayed as containing values which make democracy difficult or undesirable. This argument is sometimes used by undemocratic regimes to justify their failure to implement democratic reforms. Today, however, there are many non-Western democracies. Examples include: India, Japan, Indonesia, Namibia, Botswana, Taiwan, and South Korea. Research finds that "Western-educated leaders significantly and substantively improve a countrys democratization prospects". [ ] 
 Foreign intervention . Democracies have often been imposed by military intervention, for example in Japan and Germany after WWII. [ ] [ ] In other cases, decolonization sometimes facilitated the establishment of democracies that were soon replaced by authoritarian regimes. For example, Syria, after gaining independence from French mandatory control at the beginning of the Cold War , failed to consolidate its democracy,so it eventually collapsed and was replaced by a Baathist dictatorship . [ ] 
 Education. It has long been theorized that education promotes stable and democratic societies. [ ] Research shows that education leads to greater political tolerance, increases the likelihood of political participation and reduces inequality. [ ] One study finds "that increases in levels of education improve levels of democracy and that the democratizing effect of education is more intense in poor countries". [ ] 
 Foreign trade . A   study found that preferential trade agreements "encourage the democratization of a country, in particular if the PTA partners are themselves democracies." [ ] 
 International cooperation . A   study found that membership in international organizations "is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from   to  ." [ ] 
 Dictatorship type . Research suggests that some forms of dictatorships are more likely to democratize than others. Military dictatorships are more likely to transition to democracy than non-military dictatorships. [ ] 
 Democracy protests . Research indicates that democracy protests are associated with democratization. A   study found that about a quarter of all cases of democracy protests between  -  lead to democratization. [ ] 
 Threat of conflict. Research suggests that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions. A   study found that drought-induced riots in Sub-Saharan Africa lead regimes, fearing conflict, to make democratic concessions. [ ] 
 The death of a dictator rarely ushers in democracy. One analysis found that "of the   dictators who have died in office ( - )... in the vast majority ( %) of cases, the regime persists after the autocrats death." [ ] 
 Democracy development has often been slow, violent, and marked by frequent reversals. [ ] 
 In Great Britain, the English Civil War ( – ) was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament. [ ] The Protectorate and the English Restoration restored more autocratic rule. The Glorious Revolution in   established a strong Parliament that passed the Bill of Rights   , which codified certain rights and liberties for individuals. [ ] It set out the requirement for regular parliaments, free elections, rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch, ensuring that, unlike much of the rest of Europe, royal absolutism would not prevail. [ ] [ ] Only with the Representation of the People Act   did a majority of the males get the vote. 
 The American Revolution ( – ) created the United States. In many fields, it was a success ideologically in the sense that a relatively true republic was established that never had a single dictator, but voting rights were initially restricted to white male property owners. [ ] Slavery was not abolished in the southern states until the constitutional Amendments of the Reconstruction Era following the American Civil War ( – ) but the Civil Rights given to African-Americans were only achieved in the  s. 
 The Meiji period , after  , started the modernization of Japan. Limited democratic reforms were introduced. The Taishō period ( – ) saw more reforms. The beginning of the Shōwa period reversed this until the end of the World War II. 
 According to a study by Freedom House , in   countries where dictatorships have fallen since  , nonviolent civic resistance was a strong influence over   percent of the time. In these transitions, 
 "changes were catalyzed not through foreign invasion, and only rarely through armed revolt or voluntary elite-driven reforms, but overwhelmingly by democratic civil society organizations utilizing nonviolent action and other forms of civil resistance, such as strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, and mass protests." [ ] 
 One influential survey in democratization is that of Freedom House , which arose during the Cold War. The Freedom House, today an institution and a think tank, stands as one of the most comprehensive "freedom measures" nationally and internationally and by extension a measure of democratization. Freedom House categorizes all countries of the world according to a seven-point value system with over   questions on the survey and multiple survey representatives in various parts of every nation. The total raw points of every country places the country in one of three categories: Free, Partly Free, or not Free. 
 One study simultaneously examining the relationship between market economy (measured with one Index of Economic Freedom ), economic development (measured with GDP/capita), and political freedom (measured with the Freedom House index) found that high economic freedom increases GDP/capita and a high GDP/capita increases economic freedom. A high GDP/capita also increases political freedom but political freedom did not increase GDP/capita. There was no direct relationship either way between economic freedom and political freedom if keeping GDP/capita constant. [ ] 
 Francis Fukuyama wrote another classic in democratization studies entitled The End of History and the Last Man which spoke of the rise of liberal democracy as the final form of human government. However it has been argued that the expansion of liberal economic reforms has had mixed effects on democratization. In many ways, it is argued, democratic institutions have been constrained or "disciplined" in order to satisfy international capital markets or to facilitate the global flow of trade. [ ] 
 Samuel P. Huntington wrote The Third Wave , partly as response to Fukuyama, defining a global democratization trend in the world post WWII. Huntington defined three waves of democratization that have taken place in history. [ ] The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the  th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the Interwar period . The second wave began after World War II , but lost steam between   and the mid- s. The latest wave began in   and is still ongoing. Democratization of Latin America and the former Eastern Bloc is part of this third wave . 
 A very good example of a region which passed through all the three waves of democratization is the Middle East. During the  th century it was a part of the Ottoman Empire. In the  th century, "when the empire finally collapsed [...] towards the end of the First World War, the Western armies finally moved in and occupied the region". [ ] This was an act of both European expansion and state-building in order to democratize the region. However, what Posusney and Angrist argue is that, "the ethnic divisions [...] are [those that are] complicating the U.S. effort to democratize Iraq". This raises interesting questions about the role of combined foreign and domestic factors in the process of democratization. In addition, Edward Said labels as orientalist the predominantly Western perception of "intrinsic incompatibility between democratic values and Islam". Moreover, he states that "the Middle East and North Africa lack the prerequisites of democratization". [ ] 
 Fareed Zakaria has examined the security interests benefited from democracy promotion, pointing out the link between levels of democracy in a country and of terrorist activity. Though it is accepted that poverty in the Muslim world has been a leading contributor to the rise of terrorism, Zakaria has noted that the primary terrorists involved in the  /  attacks were among the upper and upper-middle classes. Zakaria has suggested that the society in which Al-Qaeda terrorists lived provided easy money, and therefore there existed little incentive to modernize economically or politically. [ ] With little opportunity to express themselves in the political sphere, scores of young Arab men were "invited to participate" [ ] through another avenue: the culture of Islamic fundamentalism . The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its violent expression on September  ,   illustrates an inherent need to express oneself politically, and a democratic government or one with democratic aspects (such as political openness) is quite necessary to provide a forum for political expression. 
 Larry Pardy observed that governments are motivated by political power, which is generated by two factors: legitimacy and means. The legitimacy of a democratic government is achieved through the consent of the population through fair and open elections while its financial means are derived from a healthy tax base generated by a vibrant economy. Economic success is based on a free market economy with the following elements: property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, security, and the rule of law. The core elements that support economic freedom convey the same basic rights onto individuals. Conversely, there can be no rule of law for investors when governments crack down on political opponents and no property rights for industry when personal wealth can be arbitrarily seized. 
 A sustainable democracy has to involve far more than fair and open elections. It rests on a solid foundation of economic and political freedom that, for Western nations, had to be pried from governments over centuries. It goes back at least to   when King John accepted limits on his powers and conceded certain rights in the Magna Carta. Then, as now, governments will be motivated to support rights and freedoms only when it directly impacts the governments ability to maintain and exercise political power. It does not arise with idealistic notions of democracy and freedom, implied fiscal contracts with citizens, exhortations from donor states or pronouncements from international agencies. Fukyama was essentially correct with his assertion regarding the end of history – that Western liberal democracy represents the endpoint of mankinds ideological evolution. It represents a mechanism whereby our free market system efficiently allocates resources in our economy while co-existing in a symbiotic relationship with our democratic system of government. Our governments are incentivized to protect the economy while the foundations for that economy create the conditions for democracy. [ ] 
 Although democratization is most often thought of in the context of national or regional politics, the term can also be applied to: 
 International bodies (e.g. the United Nations ) where there is an ongoing call for reform and altered voting structures and voting systems . 
 The concept of democratization can also be applied in corporations where the traditional power structure was top-down direction and the boss-knows-best (even a " Pointy-Haired Boss "); This is quite different from consultation, empowerment (of lower levels) and a diffusion of decision making (power) throughout the firm, as advocated by workplace democracy movements. 
 The loose anarchistic structure of the Internet Engineering Task Force and the Internet itself have inspired some groups to call for more democratization of how domain names are held, upheld, and lost. They note that the Domain Name System under ICANN is the least democratic and most centralized part of the Internet, using a simple model of first-come-first-served to the names of things. Ralph Nader called this "corporatization of the dictionary." 
 The democratization of knowledge is the spread of knowledge among common people, in contrast to knowledge being controlled by elite groups. 
 The trend that products from well-known designers are becoming cheaper and more available to masses of consumers. Also, the trend of companies sourcing design decisions from end users. [ ]

What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects....

 DEMONSTRATION INTRODUCTION The demonstration method teaches by exhibition and explanation. Although it is sometimes used to refer all illustrative teaching, the term demonstration usually is taken to mean explanation of a process, as opposed to exemplification of the object itself. One of the advantage of demonstration is that it trains the student in the art of careful observation, a quality which is so essential to a good nurse. The demonstration method in itself is learning through observation; it uses several senses. A second advantage of demonstration is its concrete quality. The student not only can hear the explanation, but also can see the procedure or process. As a result, the demonstration method projects a mental image in the students mind, which fortifies verbal knowledge. The demonstration method has universal appeal, because it is understandable to all and also adaptable to both individual and group teaching. MEANING 
 Demonstration as a teaching strategy refers to the visual presentation of the action and activities or practical work related to the facts and principles of a delivered lesson by the teacher in the classroom, aiming to facilitate the task of teaching and learning. A teacher while using this strategy, demonstrates in a practical form, the objects, instruments, phenomenon, action and events related to the teaching of the lesson. DEFINITION 
 “Demonstration can be defined as visualized explanation of facts, concepts and procedures”. (Basavanthappa B.,T.). The purposes of demonstration: a) Those designed to show the learners ‘how’ to perform certain psychomotor skill. Here the learner must reproduce exactly the behavior of demonstration. b) Those designed to show the learner ‘why’ certain things occur. Here the behavior is intended only as a strategy to aid the learner’s understanding of a concept of principle. Uses of the Demonstration Method 
 * To demonstrate experiments and the use of experimental equipment in the science laboratory. * To demonstrate procedures in the classroom and the ward. To review or revise procedures to meet special situation or to introduce a new procedure. * To teach the patient a procedure or treatment which he must carry out in home. * To demonstrate a procedure at the bed side or in the ward conference room. Demonstration of a procedure in its natural setting has more meaning than when carried out in an artificial environment, such as the classroom. * To demonstrate different approaches in establishing rapport with patients, so that most efficient nurse patient relationship may be established. Advantages of demonstration method 
 * It activates several senses. This increases learning, because the more senses used the better the opportunity for the learning. * It provides an opportunity for observational learning. * It clarifies the underlying principles by demonstrating the ‘why’ of a procedure. * It commands interest by use of concrete illustrations. * It correlates theory with practice. The demonstration method, as used in the teaching of nursing procedures, has several added advantages. These have particular reference to student demonstration of procedure already learned. * It gives the teacher an opportunity to evaluate the student’s knowledge of a procedure, and determine whether re-teaching is necessary. * It points out that the student must have the knowledge and must be able to apply it immediately. This, of course serves as a strong motivational force. * Return demonstration under the supervision of the teacher provides an opportunity for well directed practice before the student must use the procedure in ward. PHASES OF DEMONSTRATION 
 Planning and preparation * Formulate the behavioral objectives. * Perform a skill analysis and determine the sequence. * Assess the entry behaviors of learners and determine prerequisites. * Formulate the lesson plan, with particular reference to : a....

 Transcript of Demonstration Of Learning 
 RELIGION   DEMONSTRATION OF LEARNING OPTION  : WHY BE ETHICAL How would... Aristotle Kant Levinas Describe "The Good"? Aristotle - Happiness is the aim of the good life. Aristotle said that ethics is concerned with discovering what is good for human beings, what permits them to reach the possibilities of their nature, what is their internal orientation, or what they are intended to be. "If it is true that the spare of action whiter is an end which we wish for its own sake, and for the sake of which we wish everything else… It is clear that this will be the good or the supreme good." - The Pursuit of Happiness Aristotle was very aware of the need to maintain balance in our actions. We should avoid excess, but not avoid something completely. If to drink wine were a good, then it would be good to drink neither too much nor too little. Kant - Moral duty and obligation are expressions of the good will. Kant stated that what is good is our will to do our duty for no other reason than that it is our duty. Kant believed we need three practical principles to be able to purse and attain the supreme good. These were: 
 God: Humans cannot out of their own power achieve the supreme good. There are too many circumstances beyond our control. For this reason, Kant proposes the existence of God to allow us to achieve the Supreme good. 
 Freedom: If the supreme good is to be, in part, our achievement, then what we ought to do, we can do. To have the duty to do something we must be able to do it. Therefore, Kant argues, humans are by nature free. 
 Immortality: Achieving the supreme good is an immense task. It is impossible to obtain it completely in this life. That is why there is immortality, a life beyond, in which we can achieve the supreme good. "Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, never simply as a means but always at the same time as an end." Kant does not say we should treat others as a means. If that were the case, how could we ever hand an economy and people working for others benefits? Levinas - The ethical impact of the face of others is a trace of the Good or God. According to Levinas, the face of the other makes us responsible. In Jesus; face we see the face of God. 
 Levinas philosophy in a broad explanation, is ethical. Like Aristotles and Kants ethics, Levinas is in search of the good. But for Levinas, "The Good" is actually the central question. As most other philosophies search for the being, Levinas went on his own path of philosophy and searched for the Good itself. Which he states goes far beyond being. "Being" seeks to name the things that objects, people, plants, animals, have in common if you ignore or when you take away all the differences. But to Levinas, Everyone is very unique in their own way, and should not be down graded to being alike one another. We should celebrate our uniqueness. Levinas wanted to maintain the uniqueness of thoughts and actions. How do the choices people make have an ethical/moral dimension? 
 For us to understand how humans as a whole make choices, we must look elsewhere. Kant created a category that he called "Practical Reason". Practical Reason moves beyond simply scientific and/or empirical knowledge of the moral dimension that guides how us humans on how we decide and act upon our thoughts and ideas. Kant discovered that within the realm of knowledge, humans do not only act on impulse as we are affected by the laws of nature. But also out of our inner conscious choices based on our learned principles. 
 Definitions: 
 Autonomy: Free self-direction; responsibility. 
 "It is your autonomy, your decision, to act in accordance with your good will. You are not constrained by another." - Kant Page  , In Search of the Good 
 Ethics: A discipline that deals with the nature of the good, the nature of the human person, and criteria that we use for making right judgments. 
 Morality: A system of right conduct based on fundamental beliefs and obligation to follow certain codes, norms, customs, and habits of behaviour. Obligation: What one is bound by duty or contract to do. 
 Your ethical sense is turned on when someone orders you to do something. The experience of feeling obliged to obey a rule or law has everything to do with your ethical side. Something inside you obliges you to follow the law, or to do what is considered the right thing to do. Page  , In Search of the Good 
 Responsibility: Being morally accountable for ones actions. Responsibility presumes knowledge, freedom, and the ability to choose and to act. 
 Revelation: The ways that God makes himself known to humankind. God is fully revealed in Jesus Christ. The sacred scriptures, proclaimed within the church, are the revealed world of God. God also reveals self through people and indeed through all creation. 
  -  -   - A morally good act requires the goodness of the object, of the end, and of the circumstances all together. An evil and corrupts the action, even if the object is good in itself. The object of choice can by itself vitiate an act in its entirety. There are some concrete acts - such as fornication - that it is always wrong to choose , because choosing them entails a disorder of the will that is a moral evil. 
   - It is therefore an error to judge the morality of human acts by considering only the intention that inspires them or the circumstances which supply their context. There are acts which in and of themselves, independently of circumstances and intentions, are always gravely illicit by reason of their object; Such as blasphemy and perjury, murder and adultery. One may not do evil so that good may result from it. This scripture is saying that for an act to be morally good, the act, result, and reasons must be good. For example, a morally good act would be getting medicine for your sick mother so she can get better. The act (getting medicine) is good. The result (A healthy mother) is good. And the reason (To help someone in need) is good. A non morally good act would be if your mother was in dire need of medicine, but the store is closed so you break in. Again, the result will be good, the resin is good, but the act is not. The acts evil will corrupt the once morally good act. So you must not judge an act just based on the intention itself. 
   - "Teacher, what good deed must I do, to have eternal life?" To the young man who asked the question, Jesus answered first by invoking the necessity to recognize God as the "One there is who is good." As the supreme Good and the source of all good. Then Jesus tells him: "If you would enter life, keep the commandments." And he cites for his questioner the precepts that concern love of neighbour: "You shall not kill, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, honour your father and mother." Finally Jesus sums up these commandments positively: "You shall love your neighbour as yourself." This scripture says that to earn eternal life, we must not sin. We must follow the commandments, "Dont kill, dont commit adultery, dont steal, dont bear false witness, honour your parents, and love your others as you love yourself." We must also accept god as the one true supreme Good. He is all Good all the time. THE END

 Economic democracy or stakeholder democracy is a socioeconomic philosophy that proposes to shift decision-making power from corporate managers and corporate shareholders to a larger group of public stakeholders that includes workers, customers, suppliers, neighbors and the broader public. No single definition or approach encompasses economic democracy, but most proponents claim that modern property relations externalize costs, subordinate the general well-being to private profit, and deny the polity a democratic voice in economic policy decisions. [ ] In addition to these moral concerns, economic democracy makes practical claims, such as that it can compensate for capitalism s inherent effective demand gap. [ ] 
 Libertarians argue that ownership and control over the means of production belongs to private firms and can only be sustained by means of consumer choice, exercised daily in the marketplace. [ ] "The capitalistic social order", they claim, therefore, "is an economic democracy in the strictest sense of the word". [ ] Critics of this claim point out that consumers only vote on the value of the product when they make a purchase; they are not participating in the management of firms, or voting on how the profits are to be used. 
 Proponents of economic democracy generally argue that modern capitalism periodically results in economic crises characterized by deficiency of effective demand, as society is unable to earn enough income to purchase its output production. Corporate monopoly of common resources typically creates artificial scarcity , resulting in socio-economic imbalances that restrict workers from access to economic opportunity and diminish consumer purchasing power . [ ] [ ] Economic democracy has been proposed as a component of larger socioeconomic ideologies, as a stand-alone theory, and as a variety of reform agendas. For example, as a means to securing full economic rights , it opens a path to full political rights , defined as including the former. [ ] Both market and non-market theories of economic democracy have been proposed. As a reform agenda, supporting theories and real-world examples range from decentralization and economic liberalization to democratic cooperatives , public banking , fair trade , and the regionalization of food production and currency . 
 According to many analysts, deficiency of effective demand is the most fundamental economic problem. That is, modern society does not earn enough income to purchase its output. For example, geographer David Harvey claims, "Workers spending their wages is one source of effective demand, but the total wage bill is always less than the total capital in circulation (otherwise there would be no profit), so the purchase of wage goods that sustain daily life (even with a suburban lifestyle) is never sufficient for the profitable sale of the total output." [ ] While balanced mixed economies have existed briefly throughout history, veteran Project Manager for the U.S. Treasury Department , Richard C. Cook , and other critics claim that command economies are predominate, citing state capitalism and imperialism as related. As common resources are monopolized by imperial centers of wealth and power, conditions of scarcity are imposed artificially upon the majority, resulting in large-scale socio-economic imbalance. [ ] 
 In the Georgist view of any economic system , "wealth" includes all material things produced by labor for the satisfaction of human desires and having exchange value . Land , labor and capital are generally considered the essential factors in producing wealth. Land includes all natural opportunities and forces. Labor includes all human exertion. Capital includes the portion of wealth devoted to producing more wealth. While the income of any individual might include proceeds from any combination of these three sources—land, labor, and capital are generally considered mutually exclusive factors in economic models of the production and distribution of wealth. According to Henry George , "People seek to satisfy their desires with the least exertion". [ ] Human beings interact with nature to produce goods and services that other human beings need or desire. The laws and customs that govern the relationships among these entities constitute the economic structure of a given society. 
 Alternately, David Schweickart asserts in his book, After Capitalism : "The structure of a capitalist society consists of three basic components: 
 "The bulk of the means of production are privately owned, either directly by individuals or by corporations that are themselves owned by private individuals. 
 "Products are exchanged in a market -- that is to say, goods and services are bought and sold at prices determined for the most part by competition and not by some governmental pricing authority. Individual enterprises compete with one another in providing goods and services to consumers, each enterprise trying to make a profit. This competition is the primary determinant of prices. 
 "Most of the people who work for pay in this society work for other people, who own the means of production. Most working people are  wage labourers ." [ ] 
 Supply and demand are generally accepted as market functions for establishing prices . Organisations typically endeavor to  ) minimize the cost of production ;  ) increase sales; in order to  ) maximize profits. But, according to David Schweickart, if "those who produce the goods and services of society are paid less than their productive contribution", then as consumers they cannot buy all the goods produced, and investor confidence tends to decline, triggering declines in production and employment. Such economic instability stems from a central contradiction: Wages are both a cost of production and an essential source of effective demand (needs or desires backed with purchasing power), [ ] resulting in deficiency of effective demand along with a growing interest in economic democracy. 
 In chapter   of his book, "Community Organizing: Theory and Practice", Douglas P. Biklen discusses a variety of perspectives on "The Making of Social Problems". One of those views suggests that "writers and organizers who define social problems in terms of social and economic democracy see problems not as the experiences of poor people, but as the relationship of poverty to wealth and exploitation". Biklen states that, according to this viewpoint: 
 "[C]orporate power, upper class power, uneven distribution of wealth and prejudice cause social problems... [T]he problem is not one of poverty, but of enormous wealth. The problem is not one of gaps or cracks in an otherwise fine system but of a system which perpetuates prejudicial views concerning race, sex, age, and disability. The problem is not one of incompetence but of barriers to education, jobs, and power. Accordingly, as long as there is a deep gulf between social classes, both in terms of wealth, power, and outlook, traditional social programs will act merely as palliatives to oppression and not as a way of ending large scale human misery. This perspective is, above all, eclectic. It embraces Marxs criticism of social class inequality but is not only a social class analysis. It is anti-racist, but it is not only a theory of race equality. It favors democratic distribution of power but is also an economic theory. It can be called a social and economic democracy perspective." [ ] 
 In his   book Progress and Poverty , Henry George argued that a majority of wealth created in a "free market" economy was appropriated by land owners and monopolists through economic rents , and that concentration of such unearned wealth was the root cause of poverty. [ ] "Behind the abstraction known as the market lurks a set of institutions designed to maximize the wealth and power of the most privileged group of people in the world—the creditor-rentier class of the first world and their junior partners in the third". [ ] Schweickart claimed that private savings are not only unnecessary for economic growth, they are often harmful to the overall economy. [ ] 
 In an advanced industrial society, business credit is necessary for a healthy economy. A business that wants to expand production needs to command the labor of others, and money is the default mechanism for exercising this authority. [ ] It is often cheaper for a business to borrow capital from a bank than to stockpile cash. 
 If private savings are loaned out to entrepreneurs who use them to buy raw materials and hire workers, then aggregate demand is not reduced. [ ] However, when private savings are not reinvested, the whole economy suffers recession, unemployment, and disappearance of savings [ ] which characterize deficiency of effective demand. 
 In this view, unemployment is not an aberration, indicating any sort of systemic malfunction. Rather, unemployment is a necessary structural feature of capitalism, intended to discipline the workforce. If unemployment is too low, workers make wage demands that either cut into profits to an extent that jeopardizes future investment, or are passed on to consumers, thus generating inflationary instability. Schweickart suggested, "Capitalism cannot be a full-employment economy, except in the very short term. For unemployment is the " invisible hand "—carrying a stick—that keeps the workforce in line." [ ] In this view, Adam Smiths "invisible hand" does not seem reliable to guide economic forces on a large scale. [ ] 
 Assuming business credit could come from public sources rather than from private savers, Schweickart and other analysts consider interest payments to private savers both undeserved and unnecessary for economic growth. Moreover, the personal decision to save rather than consume decreases aggregate demand, increases the likelihood of unemployment, and exacerbates the tendency toward economic stagnation. Since wealthy people tend to save more than poor people, the propensity of an economy to slump because of excess saving becomes ever more acute as a society becomes more affluent. [ ] Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett suggested that health and social problems are significantly worse in more unequal wealthy nations. [ ] They argue that there are "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption" [ ] 
 Regarding a social and economic democracy perspective on social problems, Douglas P. Biklen states: 
 "The theme of profit superseding individual well-being flows through this antimonopoly view of social problems. On the one hand, poor and middle income people find their lives deformed by their meager or nonexistent ability to pay for goods and services. Wealthy people, on the other hand, find that their relative position, in terms of wealth and power, grows with their ability to maintain the gulf between social classes. Thus monopolies or concentrated wealth plays a large part in creating social problems. Indeed, one might say, monopolies and policies which promote the former or concentrations of wealth are the problem." [ ] 
 The discipline of economics is largely a study of scarcity management; "the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses". [ ] Absent scarcity and alternative uses of available resources, many analysts claim there is no economic problem ". For example, Richard C. Cook asserts that conditions of scarcity are artificially maintained by corporate structures that confine abundance to an exclusively entitled minority. In this view, socio-economic imbalance stems not from a failure to manage limited resources in a world of scarcity, but from mismanagement of virtually unlimited abundance and prosperity. [ ] American businessman Edward Kellogg ( – ) supports this perspective in his   book, Labor and Other Capital , where he states: 
 Money power is not only the most governing and influential, but it is also the most unjust and deceitful of all earthly powers. It entails upon millions excessive toil, poverty and want, while it keeps them ignorant of the cause of their sufferings; for, with their tacit consent, it silently transfers a large share of their earnings into the hands of others, who have never lifted a finger to perform any productive labor. [ ] 
 While he considers these functions a public wrong, Kellogg also asserted the responsibility of the public to find and implement a remedy. Generally considered monopoly power , some view this "public wrong" as the most influential factor in artificial scarcity . For example, Henry George further suggested: 
 There is in reality no conflict between labor and capital; the true conflict is between labor and monopoly... Abolish the monopoly that forbids men to employ themselves and capital could not possibly oppress labor... [R]emove the cause of that injustice which deprives the laborer of the capital his toil creates and the sharp distinction between capitalist and laborer would, in fact, cease to exist". [ ] 
 For example, many analysts consider invention a "more or less costless store of knowledge, captured by monopoly capital and protected in order to make it secret and a rare and scarce commodity, for sale at monopoly prices. So far as invention is concerned, a price is put on them not because they are scarce but in order to make them scarce to those who want to use them." [ ] [ ] [ ] Patent monopolies raise share prices above tangible labor value. The difference between labor-value and monopoly-value raises goods prices, and is collected as "profit" by intermediaries who have contributed nothing to earn it. [ ] 
 Analysts generally agree that such conditions typically result in a deficiency of effective demand. Labor does not earn enough to buy what enterprises produce. For example, Richard C. Cook maintains that the difference between earnings and prices is typically appropriated by industrial and banking centers of capital through monopoly control of finance and other market resources. Such exclusive entitlement tends to artificially impose conditions of economic scarcity upon the majority of the population. [ ] While the accelerating advance of technology, developed and maintained by labor, tends to generate abundance, this process depresses wages as workers are replaced by machines, ironically minimizing the purchasing power of workers in the market. [ ] According to Jack Rasmus, author of The Trillion Dollar Income Shift , in June  , investment bank Goldman Sachs reported: "The most important contribution to the higher profit margins over the past five years has been a decline in Labors share of national income." [ ] 
 The term "land" typically denotes the "universe of natural opportunities" or "public utilities", generally known as the commons . Artificially restricted access of labor to common resources is generally considered monopoly or enclosure of the commons . Due to the economic imbalance inherently imposed, such monopoly structures tend to be centrally dictated by law, and must be maintained by military force, trade agreements, or both. [ ] 
 In  , American journalist Ambrose Bierce defined "land" as: 
 A part of the earths surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society.... Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist". [ ] 
 In The Servile State ( ), Hilaire Belloc referred to the Enclosures Movement when he said, "England was already captured by a wealthy oligarchy before the series of great industrial discoveries began". If you sought the accumulated wealth preliminary to launching new industry, "you had to turn to the class which had already monopolized the bulk of the means of production in England. The rich men alone could furnish you with those supplies". [ ] 
 According to Peter Barnes , author of Capitalism  .  , when Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in  , the dominant form of business was partnership, in which regional groups of co-workers ran co-owned businesses. From this perspective, many considered the corporate model—stock sold to strangers—inherently prone to fraud. While numerous scandals historically support this dim view of corporate policy, small partnerships could not possibly compete with the aggregate capital generated by corporate economies of scale . The greatest advantage of corporations over any other business model is their ability to raise capital from strangers. The corporate model benefits from laws that limit stockholders liability to the amounts they have invested. [ ] 
 In A Preface To Economic Democracy , Robert A. Dahl suggests that agrarian economy and society in the early United States "underwent a revolutionary transformation into a new system of commercial and industrial capitalism that automatically generated vast inequalities of wealth, income, status , and power ." Dahl claims that such inequalities result from the " liberty to accumulate unlimited economic resources and to organize economic activity into hierarchically governed enterprises." [ ] 
 The rise of corporations and ending labor shortage [ edit ] 
 According to author Greg MacLeod, the concept of the corporation originated in Roman times. However, "the modern business corporation evolved radically from its ancient roots into a form with little relation to the purpose as understood by historians of law." John Davis, a legal historian, noted that the precursor of the business corporation was the first monastery , established in the sixth century, the purpose of which was to serve society. Most business corporations before   developed in Great Britain, where they were established by royal charter , with the expectation of contributions to society. Incorporation was a privilege granted in return for service to the crown or the nation. MacLeod goes on to say: 
 A corporation is considered by the law to exist as a legal person. In the Middle Ages it was called a "persona ficta". This is a very useful way of looking at a business corporation, because it suggests correctly that the corporate person has a certain personality. It has duties and responsibilities vested unto it by the legitimate government or society that fostered it. The corporate person receives great benefits from society – and, in return, it must exercise great responsibilities. One of the most basic responsibilities is job creation, a fundamental need in any society." [ ] 
 By the mid-nineteenth century, corporations could live forever, engage in any legal activity, and merge with or acquire other corporations. In  , the U.S. Supreme Court legally recognized corporations as “persons”, entitled under the Fourteenth Amendment to the same protections as living citizens . Unlike average citizens, large corporations had large flows of money at their disposal. With this money they can hire lobbyists , donate copiously to politicians, and sway public opinion . 
 But, despite Supreme Court rulings, the modern corporation is not a real person. Rather, the publicly traded stock corporation is what Barnes terms an " automaton ", explicitly designed to maximize return to its owners. A corporation never sleeps or slows down. It externalizes as many costs as possible, and never reaches an upper limit of profitability, because no such limit has yet been established. As a result, corporations keep getting larger. In  , sales of the Fortune   accounted for one-third of U.S. gross domestic product. By   they commanded two-thirds. In other words, these few hundred corporations replaced smaller firms organized as partnerships or proprietorships . Corporations have established a homogeneous global playing field around which they can freely move raw materials, labor, capital, finished products, tax-paying obligations, and profits. Thus, corporate franchise has become a perpetual grant of sovereignty , including immortality , self-government , and limited liability . By the end of the twentieth century, corporate power—both economic and political—stretched worldwide. International agreements not only lowered tariffs but extended corporate property rights and reduced the ability of sovereign nations to regulate corporations. [ ] 
 David Schweickart submits that such "hypermobility of capital" generates economic and political insecurity. [ ] "If the search for lower wages comes to dominate the movement of capital, the result will be not only a lowering of worldwide wage disparities (the good to which some economists point) but also a lowering of total global income (a straight-out utilitarian bad)." [ ] Jack Rasmus, author of The War At Home and The Trillion Dollar Income Shift , argues that increasing concentration of corporate power is a cause of the large-scale debt, unemployment, and poverty characteristics of economic recession and depression . According to Rasmus, income inequality in contemporary America increased as the relative share of income for corporations and the wealthiest one per cent of households rose while income shares declined for  -percent of the United States workforce. After rising steadily for three decades after World War II, the standard of living for most American workers has sharply declined between the mid- s to the present. Rasmus likens the widening income gap in contemporary American society to the decade leading up to the Great Depression , estimating "well over $  trillion in income is transferred annually from the roughly   million working class families in America to corporations and the wealthiest non-working-class households. While a hundred new billionaires were created since  , real weekly earnings for   million workers are less in   than in   when Ronald Reagan took office". 
 According to economist Richard D. Wolff , the  s brought an end to the labor shortage which had facilitated more than a century of rising average real wages in the United States. [ ] Wolff says Americans responded to the resulting deficiency of effective demand by working more hours and excessive borrowing; the latter paving the way for the financial crisis of  –  . [ ] 
 According to David Harvey, "the export of capital and the cultivation of new markets around the world" is a solution "as old as capitalism itself" for the deficiency of effective demand. [ ] Imperialism, as defined by Dictionary of Human Geography , is "the creation and/or maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states and often in the form of an empire, based on domination and subordination." [ ] "These geographic shifts", according to David Harvey, "are the heart of uneven geographic development". [ ] 
 Vladimir Lenin viewed imperialism as the highest stage of capitalism. He asserted that the merging of banks and industrial cartels gave rise to finance capital, which was then exported (rather than goods) in pursuit of greater profits than the home market could offer. Political and financial power became divided among international monopolist firms and European states, colonizing large parts of the world in support of their businesses. [ ] According to analyst Michael Parenti, imperialism is "the process whereby the dominant politico-economic interests of one nation expropriate for their own enrichment the land, labor, raw materials, and markets of another people." [ ] Parenti says imperialism is older than capitalism. Given its expansionist nature, capitalism has little inclination to stay home. While he conceded imperialism is not typically recognized as a legitimate allegation about the United States, Parenti argued: 
 "Emperors and conquistadors were interested mostly in plunder and tribute, gold and glory. Capitalist imperialism differs from these earlier forms in the way it systematically accumulates capital through the organized exploitation of labor and the penetration of overseas markets. Capitalist imperialism invests in other countries, transforming and dominating their economies, cultures, and political life, integrating their financial and productive structures into an international system of capital accumulation." [ ] 
 In his book, The Political Struggle for the  st century , J.W. Smith examines the economic basis for the history of imperial civilization. On a global scale, he says developed nations tended to impede or prohibit the economic and technological advancement of weaker developing countries through the military force, martial law, and inequitable practices of trade that typically characterize colonialism . Rhetorically termed as " survival of the fittest ", or " might makes right ", such economic crises stem from the imbalances imposed by corporate imperialism . Just as cities in the Middle Ages monopolized the means of production by conquering and controlling the sources of raw materials and countryside markets, Smith claims that contemporary centers of capital now control our present world through private monopoly of public resources sometimes known as "the commons". Through inequalities of trade, developing countries are overcharged for import of manufactured goods and underpaid for raw material exports, as wealth is siphoned from the periphery of empire and hoarded at the imperial-centers-of-capital: 
 "Over eight-hundred years ago the powerful of the city-states of Europe learned to control the resources and markets of the countryside by raiding and destroying others’ primitive industrial capital, thus openly monopolizing that capital and establishing and maintaining extreme inequality of pay. This low pay siphoned the wealth of the countryside to the imperial-centers-of-capital. The powerful had learned to plunder-by-trade and have been refining those skills ever since." [ ] 
 Smith goes on to say that, like other financial empires in history, the contemporary model forms alliances necessary to develop and control wealth, keeping peripheral nations impoverished providers of cheap resources for the imperial capital centers. Belloc estimated that, during the British Enclosures, "perhaps half of the whole population was proletarian ", while roughly the other "half" owned and controlled the means of production. Under modern Capitalism, J.W. Smith claimed that fewer than   individuals possess more wealth than half of the earth’s population. The wealth of  /  of  -percent of the United States population roughly equals that of the lower  -percent. [ ] 
 Richard Cook claimed that the United States maintained stability by economically dominating the world as a means of filling the gap between production and consumption. Beginning with loans to European combatants during World War I, and continuing through the lend-lease program of World War II, U.S. domination of trade peaked through economic recovery measures following those wars. Though forming the basis for U.S. prosperity during the  s and  s, U.S trade domination was exhausted by the mid- s, when the United States implemented a policy known as dollar hegemony , intended to stabilize the economy. [ ] 
 Advocating for an "alternative economic system free of capitalisms structural flaws", [ ] economist Richard D. Wolff says reform agendas are fundamentally inadequate, given that capitalist corporations, the dominant institutions of the existing system, retain the incentives and the resources to undo any sort of reform policy. For example, Wolff goes on to say: 
 "The New Deal –era taxes on business and the rich and regulations of enterprise behavior proved vulnerable and unsustainable. The enemies of the New Deal had the incentives (profit maximization) and the resources (their returns on investments) to undo many of its reforms after World War II , with ever-greater effect in the period since the  s. They systematically evaded, then weakened, the taxes and regulations of the New Deal, and eventually, when politically possible, eliminated them altogether. Business profits funded the parties, politicians, public relations campaigns, and professional think tanks that together shaped the real social effects and historical decline of government economic regulation. Examples include the destruction of the Glass-Steagall Act , the current assault on Social Security , the shift in the federal tax burden from business to individuals and from upper- to middle-income individuals, and so on." [ ] 
 According to David Schweickart, a serious critique of any problem cannot be content to merely note the negative features of the existing model . Instead, we must specify precisely the structural features of an alternative: "But if we want to do more than simply denounce the evils of capitalism, we must confront the claim that there is no alternative—by proposing one." [ ] Schweickart argued that both full employment and guaranteed basic income are impossible under the restrictions of the U.S. economic system for two primary reasons: a) unemployment is an essential feature of capitalism, not an indication of systemic failure; [ ] and b) while capitalism thrives under polyarchy , it is not compatible with genuine democracy. [ ] Assuming these "democratic deficits" significantly impact the management of both the workplace and new investment, [ ] many proponents of economic democracy tend to favor the creation and implementation of a new economic model over reform of the existing one. 
 For example, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. claimed "Communism forgets that life is individual. Capitalism forgets that life is social, and the Kingdom of Brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of Communism nor the antithesis of Capitalism but in a higher synthesis. It is found in a higher synthesis that combines the truths of both". [ ] Regarding the gap between productivity and purchasing power, Dr. King maintained: 
 "The problem indicates that our emphasis must be two-fold. We must create full employment or we must create incomes. People must be made consumers by one method or the other. Once they are placed in this position, we need to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted. New forms of work that enhance the social good will have to be devised for those for whom traditional jobs are not available." [ ] 
 According to historian and political economist, Gar Alperovitz : "King’s final judgment stands as instructive evidence of his understanding of the nature of systemic challenge — and also as a reminder that given the failures of both traditional socialism and corporate capitalism, it is time to get serious about clarifying not only the question of strategy, but what, in fact, the meaning of changing the system in a truly democratic direction might one day entail." [ ] 
 Trade unionist and social activist Allan Engler argued further that economic democracy was the working-class alternative to capitalism. In his book, "Economic Democracy", Engler stated: 
 "When economic democracy – a world of human equality, democracy and cooperation – is the alternative, capitalism will no longer be seen as a lesser evil. When the working class, not a revolutionary party, is the agency of social transformation, change will be based on workplace organization, community mobilizations and democratic political action. The goal will be to transform capitalism into economic democracy through gains and reforms that improve living conditions while methodically replacing wealth-holders entitlement with human entitlement, capitalist ownership with community ownership and master-servant relations with workplace democracy." [ ] 
 Assuming that "democracy is not just a political value, but one with profound economic implications, the problem is not to choose between plan and market , but to integrate these institutions into a democratic framework". [ ] Like capitalism, economic democracy can be defined in terms of three basic features: 
 Worker self-management: Each productive enterprise is controlled democratically by its workers. 
 Social control of investment: Funds for new investment are returned to the economy through a network of public investment banks." [ ] 
 The market: Enterprises interact with one another and with consumers in an environment largely free of governmental price controls. Raw materials, instruments of production and consumer goods are all bought and sold at prices largely determined by the forces of supply and demand. 
 In real-world practice, Schweickart concedes economic democracy will be more complicated and less "pure" than his model. However, to grasp the nature of the system and to understand its essential dynamic, it is important to have a clear picture of the basic structure. Capitalism is characterized by private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. The Soviet economic model subordinated private ownership of productive resources to public ownership by collectivizing farms and factories. It further subordinated the market to central planning—but retained the institution of wage labor. [ ] 
 Most proposed models for economic democracy generally begin with democratizing the workplace and the ownership of capital. Other proposals advocate replacing the market with some form of planning, as well. 
 In worker self-management, each productive enterprise is controlled by those who work there. Workers are responsible for the operation of the facility, including organization, discipline, production techniques, and the nature, price, and distribution of products. Decisions concerning distribution are made democratically. Problems of authority delegation are solved by democratic representation. Management is chosen by the worker, not appointed by the State, not elected by the community at large and not selected by a board of directors elected by stockholders . Ultimate authority rests with the enterprises workers, following the one-person, one-vote principle. [ ] 
 According to veteran World Bank economic adviser David P. Ellerman its the employment contract that needs to be abolished, not private property. In other words, "a firm can be socialized and yet remain private in the sense of not being government-owned." [ ] In his book, "The Democratic Firm", Ellerman stated: 
 In the world today, the main form of enterprise is based on renting human beings ( privately or publicly ). Our task is to construct the alternative. In the alternative type of firm, employment by the firm is replaced with membership in the firm. Economic democracy requires the abolition of the employment relation, not the abolition of private property . Democracy can be married with private property in the workplace; the result of the union is the democratic worker-owned firm." [ ] 
 Alternately, in Schweickart’s model, workers control the workplace, but they do not "own" the means of production. Productive resources are regarded as the collective property of the society. Workers run the enterprise, use its capital assets as they see fit, and distribute the profits among themselves. Here, societal "ownership" of the enterprise manifests itself in two ways:  ) All firms pay tax on their capital assets , which goes into societys investment fund. In effect, workers rent capital assets from society.  ) Firms are required to preserve the value of the capital stock entrusted to them. This means that a depreciation fund must be maintained to repair or replace existing capital stock. This money may be spent on capital replacements or improvements, but not to supplement workers incomes. [ ] 
 Italy’s Legacoop and Spain’s Mondragon multi-sectoral worker-cooperatives have both been able to reach significant scale and demonstrate long-term sustainability. According to a study conducted by Massachusetts Institute of Technology , the greatest lesson to be learned from these European experiences is the importance of developing an economically integrated network of cooperatives rather than a single cooperative. [ ] The report goes on to say: 
 In a market based economy the cooperative business form suffers from several strategic challenges when operating independently. One worker cooperative on its own is most likely doomed to fail in a highly competitive global economy. However, an ecosystem of several worker cooperatives and support organizations can create an infrastructure that leads to sustained growth and expansion. In Mondragon the cooperative network expanded from a single cooperative polytechnic school to a network of   industrial, retail, finance, educational, and research and development firms. 
 While there is no single approach or blueprint for social control of investment, many strategies have been proposed. For example, Gar Alperovitz claims many real-world strategies have already emerged to democratize and decentralize the ownership of wealth and capital. In addition to worker cooperatives, Alperovitz highlights ESOPs, credit unions and other cooperative forms, social enterprises , municipally-owned utilities and public banks as starting points for what he has termed a " Pluralist Commonwealth ". [ ] 
 Alternately, David Schweickart proposes a flat-rate tax on capital assets to replace all other business taxes. This "capital assets tax" is collected and invested by the central government. Funds are dispersed throughout society, first to regions and communities on a per capita basis, then to public banks in accordance with past performance, then to those firms with profitable project proposals. Profitable projects that promise increased employment are favored over those that do not. At each level, national, regional and local, legislatures decide what portion of their funds is to be used for public capital expenditures, then send the remainder to the next lower level. Associated with most banks are entrepreneurial divisions, which promote firm expansion and new firm creation. For large (regional or national) enterprises, local investment banks are complemented by regional and national investment banks. These too would be public institutions that receive their funds from the national investment fund. 
 Banks are public, not private, institutions that make grants , not loans, to business enterprises. According to Schweickart, these grants do not represent "free money", since an investment grant counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring interest payments but no repayment of principal . [ ] 
 While an economy of worker-self-managed enterprises might tend toward lower unemployment than under capitalism, [ why? ] Schweickart says it does not guarantee full employment . Social control of investment serves to increase employment. If the market provides insufficient employment, the public sector becomes the employer of last resort . The original formulation of the U.S. Humphrey-Hawkins Act of   assumed that only in this way could full employment be assured in a market economy. Economic Democracy adopts this approach. Social control of investment then blocks the cyclical unemployment typical of capitalism. [ ] 
 Hungarian historian Karl Polanyi suggested that market economies should subordinate themselves to larger societal needs. He states that human-beings, the source of labor , do not reproduce for the sole purpose of providing the market with workers. In The Great Transformation Polanyi says that, while modern states and market economies tend to grow under capitalism, both are mutually interdependent for functional development. In order for market economies to be truly prosperous, he claims social constructs must play an essential role. With the term "fictitious commodities", Polanyi claimed that land , labor, and money are all commodified under capitalism, though the inherent purpose of these items was never intended "for sale"—what he labels " Fictitious commodities ." He says natural resources are "God-given", money is a bookkeeping entry validated by law, and labor is a human prerogative, not a personal obligation to market economies. 
 Schweickarts economic democracy is a form of market economy , at least insofar as the allocation of consumer and capital goods is concerned. Firms buy raw materials and machinery from other firms and sell their products to other enterprises or consumers. "Prices are largely unregulated except by supply and demand, although in some cases price controls or price supports might be in order – as they are deemed in order in most real-world forms of capitalism." [ ] 
 Without a price mechanism sensitive to supply and demand, it is extremely difficult for a producer or planner to know what and how much to produce, and which production and marketing methods are the most efficient. Otherwise, it is difficult to motivate producers to be both efficient and innovative . Market competition resolves these problems, to a significant if incomplete degree, in a non-authoritarian , non-bureaucratic fashion. 
 Schweikart claims that centralized planning is inherently flawed, and schemes for decentralized non-market planning are unworkable. He argues that the historical record confirms that central planning is both inefficient and conducive to an authoritarian concentration of power, a lesson he says is to be drawn from the Soviet experience . 
 Enterprises still strive to make a profit. However, "profit" in a worker-run firm is calculated differently than under capitalism. For a capitalist firm, labor is counted as a cost. For a worker-run enterprise it is not. Labor is not another "factor of production" on par with land and capital. Labor is the residual claimant. Workers get all that remains, once other costs, including depreciation set asides and the capital assets tax, have been paid. [ ] 
 Because of the way workplaces and the investment mechanism are structured, Schweickarts model aims to facilitate fair trade , not free trade , between nations. Under Economic Democracy, there would be virtually no cross-border capital flows. Enterprises themselves would not relocate abroad, since they are democratically controlled by their own workers. Finance capital stays mostly at home, since funds for investment are publicly generated and are mandated by law to be reinvested domestically. "Capital doesnt flow into the country, either, since there are no stocks nor corporate bonds nor businesses to buy. The capital assets of the country are collectively owned – and hence not for sale." [ ] 
 According to Michael Howard, "in preserving commodity exchange, a market socialism has greater continuity with the society it displaces than does nonmarket socialism, and thus it is more likely to emerge from capitalism as a result of tendencies generated within it." But Howard also suggested, "one argument against the market in socialist society has been that it blocks progress toward full communism or even leads back to capitalism". [ ] From this perspective, nonmarket models of economic democracy have also been proposed. 
 Economic democracy as part of an Inclusive Democracy [ edit ] 
 Economic democracy is described as an integral component of an inclusive democracy , in Takis Fotopoulos Towards An Inclusive Democracy as a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalization of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. 
 The proposed system aims to meet the basic needs of all citizens ( macroeconomic decisions), and secure freedom of choice ( microeconomic decisions). Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: ( ) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and a confederal assembly, and ( ) an artificial market using personal vouchers , which ensures freedom of choice but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although David Pepper called this system "a form of money based on the labour theory of value", [ ] it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth. [ citation needed ] 
 Another distinguishing feature of inclusive democracy is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is determined separately according to the cost of basic needs, and according to degree of effort for non-basic needs. Inclusive democracy is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast, participatory economics guarantees that basic needs are satisfied only for public goods or are covered by compassion and by a guaranteed basic income for the unemployed and those who cannot work. [ ] Many advocates of participatory economics and Participism have contested this. [ citation needed ] 
 As part of inclusive democracy, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all macroeconomic decisions (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used, etc.) are made collectively and without representation. However, microeconomic decisions are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of vouchers. [ citation needed ] 
 As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy is only feasible if the participants can easily cooperate. 
 Assuming the most basic requirement for societal prosperity is a healthy, educated, and enterprising population, [ ] Economic Democracy seeks to close the gap between purchasing power and productive output. While reform agendas tend to critique the existing system and recommend corrective measures, they do not necessarily suggest alternative models to replace the fundamental structures of capitalism; private ownership of productive resources, the market, and wage labor. 
 Rather than an economic shortfall, many analysts [ who? ] consider the gap between production and purchasing power a social dividend. In this view, credit is a public utility rather than debt to financial centers. Once reinvested in human productive potential, the surplus of societal output could actually increase Gross Domestic Product rather than throttling it, resulting in a more efficient economy, overall. [ ] Social Credit is an economic reform movement that originates from theories developed by Scottish engineer Major C. H. Douglas . His aim to make societal improvement the goal of economic systems is reflected in the term "Social Credit", and published in his book, entitled Economic Democracy . In this view, the term "economic democracy" does not mean worker control of industry. [ ] While technological advancement tends to increase unemployment along with productivity, Douglas suggests that our perspective will determine whether this problem is a "catastrophe" or a "magnificent achievement": 
 "The so-called unemployment problem is really a problem of leisure. The problem really is a problem, first of the distribution of purchasing power to those who are not required, and will decreasingly be required, in the industrial system, and secondly, of ensuring that the total purchasing distributed shall always be enough to pay for the goods and services for sale." [ ] 
 A national dividend and a compensated price mechanism are the two most essential components of the Social Credit program. While these measures have never been implemented in their purest form, they have provided a foundation for Social Credit political parties in many countries and for reform agendas that retain the title, "economic democracy". 
 Following Douglas and a reform program based on direct government spending set forth by groups such as the American Monetary Institute , veteran Project Manager for the U.S. Treasury Department , Richard C. Cook proposes two general measures, which together he terms, "economic democracy": [ ] 
 Credit as a public utility: "We should spend sufficient credit into existence to supply the basic operating expenses of government at all levels without recourse to either taxes or borrowing. At least ninety percent of all taxes could be eliminated. The only taxes that should be retained would be those in the form of user fees for infrastructure operations and maintenance and those levied only for dire emergencies. Capital expenses for infrastructure construction at the federal, state, and local levels should be financed through a self-capitalized national infrastructure bank lending at zero-interest. Operating on a national scale, such a bank could begin to rebuild our job base starting at the state and local levels. A public program of direct government expenditures as described herein would be as effective, as timely, far less inflationary, and much cheaper than creating new public debt by borrowing credit created out of thin air by the banking system." [ ] 
 A national dividend: "The endemic gap between prices and purchasing power in an advanced economic system in reality is the “leisure dividend” that we never received from our amazing producing economy. That gap should now be filled by a non-taxable national dividend of two types. One would be a cash stipend paid to all citizens which would also serve the purpose of eliminating poverty by providing everyone with a basic income guarantee. The remainder of the national dividend would consist of an overall pricing subsidy, whereby a designated proportion of all purchases, including home building expenses, would be rebated to consumers. The average national dividend per person would probably exceed $ ,  per year under today’s economic conditions. It would be a calculated value charged against a government ledger but would be off-budget, with no need to finance it with taxation or borrowing [ ] 
 While Smith and others suggest an economic crisis might be necessary to drive a movement toward large-scale economic democracy, [ ] [ ] Cook argues that "most economic reform programs address symptoms, not causes": [ ] 
 " Monetary reform embraces the enormous productivity of modern industrial methods with approval and hope. But it identifies factors in the nature of industrial production at the level of the corporation as creating a chronic state of instability". [ ] "The top priority of the reform program would be to use public credit to rebuild the producing economy which has been wrecked by the phony ideology of market economics and the inept and self-serving manipulation of the money supply by the Federal Reserve and the banks." [ ] 
 Cook avoided collectivist solutions. Rather, he affirmed the value of "democratic capitalism," combined with a shift to more public control of credit, and suggested a new approach to achieving worldwide prosperity, starting with economic recovery in the United States. Cooks argument stemmed from prior success in the United States treating credit as a public utility, including colonial paper currencies which allowed an emerging American society to monetize the value of its goods and services, the Greenbacks issued by President Abraham Lincoln during the American civil war , and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) which moved to recapitalize failing state banks in rural areas and small towns during the Great Depression . While President Herbert Hoover s efforts failed, Cook credits RFC programs with providing low interest loans to the railroad industry, farmers, exporters, state and local governments, and wartime industries over a period of at least   years. [ ] 
 Cook also proposed a national dividend, sometimes known as a Basic Income Guarantee or "BIG", was advocated in the United States by economists, politicians and reformers, including Thomas Paine , Milton Friedman , Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. , and John Kenneth Galbraith . Friedman originally proposed a negative income tax to support this system, but then opposed the bill because its revised implementation would have merely supplemented rather than replacing existing tax-structures. Cook suggested that racism might have been at the root of BIGs demise in the late  s, as "many beneficiaries of the program would have been African-American". [ ] In  , State Representative Bob Filner (D-CA) as H.R.  , proposed a basic income guarantee. [ ] According to the U.S. Basic Income Guarantee Network: 
 "The basic income guarantee (BIG) is a government insured guarantee that no citizens income will fall below some minimal level for any reason. All citizens would receive a BIG without means test or work requirement. BIG is an efficient and effective solution to poverty that preserves individual autonomy and work incentives while simplifying government social policy. Some researchers estimate that a small BIG, sufficient to cut the poverty rate in half could be financed without an increase in taxes by redirecting funds from spending programs and tax deductions aimed at maintaining incomes." [ ] 
 Cook suggests existing U.S. (GDP) could support such a system. GDP of $ . -trillion minus $ . -trillion in purchasing power ("wages") equals a difference of $ . -trillion. Distributed equally amongst United States citizens, Cook estimates a "National Dividend" of approximately $ ,  could be provided annually to every U.S. citizen. A primary function of monetary reform is to "provide sufficient individual income"—not merely "create jobs"—for American workers displaced by technological advancement, outsourcing, and other economic influences beyond their control. Funding of the National Dividend would be drawn from a national credit account, which would include all factors that generate production costs and create new capital assets. The national credit account could also be used for price subsidies to discourage manufacturers from cutting costs by shipping jobs overseas. Rather than Federal Reserve Notes , circulated only through debt payable to a bank with interest, the National Dividend would be "real money", based on the productive capacity of the economy expressed as GDP. Cook says, "its important to realize that Social Credit is not a socialist system. Rather it is democratic capitalism, in contrast to the finance capitalism that has become so damaging". [ ] Rooted in the ideals of Social Credit, proposed by Douglas in the  s, Cook explains: 
 "The difference between a National Dividend and a basic income guarantee is that the dividend is tied to production and consumption data and may vary from year to year. During years that the dividend falls below a designated threshold, the balance of a basic income guarantee could be provided from tax revenues. But in a highly automated economy such as that of the U.S., the National Dividend would normally be sufficient". [ ] 
 In his book, Capitalism  .  , Peter Barnes likens a "National Dividend" to the game of Monopoly , where all players start with a fair distribution of financial opportunity to succeed, and try to privatize as much as they can as they move around "the commons". Distinguishing the board game from real-world business, Barnes claims that "the top   percent of the population owns more property than the remaining   percent", providing the smaller minority with an unfair advantage of approximately "$ -trillion" annually, at the beginning of the game. Contrasting "redistribution" of income (or property) with "predistribution", Barnes argues for "propertizing" (without corporately privatizing) "the commons" to spread ownership universally, without taking wealth from some and giving it to others. His suggested mechanism to this end is the establishment of a "Commons Sector", ensuring payment from the Corporate Sector for "the commons" they utilize, and equitably distributing the proceeds for the benefit of contemporary and future generations of society. 
 One real-world example of such reform is in the U.S. State of Alaska , where each citizen receives an annual share of the part of the states oil revenues via the " Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend ". Barnes suggests this model could extend to other states and nations because "we jointly own many valuable assets". As corporate pollution of common assets increased, the permits for such pollution would become more scarce, driving prices for those permits up. "Less pollution would equal more revenue", and over time, "trillions of dollars could flow into an American Permanent Fund". [ ] 
 However, none of these proposals aspire to the mandates recommended by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: 
 Two conditions are indispensable if we are to ensure that the guaranteed income operates as a consistently progressive measure. First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows. Were it permitted to remain static under growth conditions, the recipients would suffer a relative decline. If periodic reviews disclose that the whole national income has risen, then the guaranteed income would have to be adjusted upward by the same percentage. Without these safeguards a creeping retrogression would occur, nullifying the gains of security and stability. [ ] 
 Barnes deem any such reform unlikely. Thomas Paine originally recommended a National Dividend to compensate for the brutality of British Enclosures, but his idea was never adopted. [ ] 
 Rather than superficially compensating for legalized inequities, Smith recommends abolishing or redefining property rights laws with particular respect for "the commons". [ ] According to Smith exclusive title to natural resources and technologies should be converted to inclusive conditional titles—the condition being that society should collect rental values on all natural resources. [ ] Smith suggests the basic principles of monopolization under feudalism were never abandoned, and residues of exclusive feudal property rights restrict the potential efficiency of capitalism in Western cultures . [ ] He estimated that roughly   percent of American capital is little more than capitalized values of unearned wealth. He proposed that elimination of these monopoly values would double economic efficiency , maintain quality of life , and reduce working hours by half. Wasteful monetary flows could be stopped only by eliminating all methods of monopolization typical in Western economies. [ ] 
 Smith divided "primary (feudal) monopoly" into four general categories: banking; land; technology and communications . He listed three general categories of "secondary (modern) monopoly"; insurance, law, health care. [ ] Smith further claimed that converting these exclusive entitlements to inclusive human rights would minimize battles for market share , thereby eliminating most offices and staff needed to maintain monopoly structures, and stop the wars generated to protect them. Dissolving roughly half the economic activity of a monopoly system would reduce the costs of common resources by roughly half, and significantly minimize the most influential factors of poverty. [ ] 
 In Smiths view, most taxes should be eliminated, and productive enterprise should be privately owned and managed. [ ] Inventors should be paid well and all technology placed in the public domain. Crucial services currently monopolized through licensing should be legislated as human rights. [ ] 
 Smith envisioned a balanced economy under a socially owned banking commons within an inclusive society with full and equal rights for all. [ ] Federated regions collect resource rents on land and technology to a social fund to operate governments and care for social needs. [ ] Socially owned banks provide finance capital by creating debt-free money for social infrastructure and industry. [ ] Rental values return to society through expenditure on public infrastructures. Local labor is trained and employed to build and maintain water systems, sewers, roads, communication systems, railroads, ports, airports, post offices, and education systems. [ ] Purchasing power circulates regionally, as labor spends wages in consumption and governments spend resource rent and banking profits to maintain essential services. [ ] 
 According to Smith, all monetary systems, including money markets , should function within fractional-reserve banking . [ ] Financial capital should be the total savings of all citizens, balanced by primary-created money to fill any shortfall, or its destruction through increased reserve requirements to eliminate any surplus. [ ] Adjustments of required reserves should facilitate the balance between building with socially created money or savings. Any shortage of savings within a socially owned banking system should be alleviated by simply printing it. [ ] 
 A cooperative is a limited liability entity, organized either for-profit or not-for-profit, that differs from a corporation in that its producing members, rather than investors, comprise the decision-making authority. By various names, cooperatives play an essential role in all forms of Economic Democracy. Classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives , the cooperative business model is fundamental to the interests of economic democracy. 
 According to the International Cooperative Alliance s Statement on the Cooperative Identity , "cooperatives are democratic organizations controlled by their members, who actively participate in setting policies and making decisions. Men and women serving as elected representatives are accountable to the membership. In primary cooperatives members have equal voting rights (one member, one vote) and cooperatives at other levels are also organized in a democratic manner." [ ] 
 According to the United States Federation of Worker Cooperatives : "Worker cooperatives are business entities that are owned and controlled by their members, the people who work in them. The two central characteristics of worker cooperatives are:  ) workers invest in and own the business and ( ) decision-making is democratic, generally adhering to the principle of one worker-one vote." Worker cooperatives occupy multiple sectors and industries in the United States, mostly in the Northeast, the West Coast and the Upper Midwest, totaling   democratic workplaces in the United States, employing over  ,  people and generating over $  million in annual revenues. While a few are larger enterprises, most are small. Growing steadily between   and  , technology and home health care experienced most of the recent increase. [ ] 
 Worker cooperatives generally employ an industrial model called workplace democracy , which rejects the "master-servant relationship" implicit in the traditional employment contract. [ ] According to Wilkinson and Pickett, neither ownership or participation alone are sufficient to establish democracy in the workplace. "[M]any share-ownership schemes amount to little more than incentive schemes, intended to make employees more compliant with management and sometimes to provide a nest-egg for retirement... To make a reliable difference to company performance, share-ownership has to be combined with more participative management methods." [ ] Dahl further argued that self-governing enterprises should not be confused with other systems they might resemble: 
 "Self-governing enterprises only remotely resemble pseudodemocratic schemes of employee consultation by management; schemes of limited employee participation that leave all critical decisions with a management elected by stockholders; or Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) that are created only or primarily to provide corporations with low-interest loans, lower corporate income taxes, greater cash flow, employee pension plans, or a market for their stock, without, however, any significant changes in control." [ ] 
 In worker cooperatives, net income is called surplus instead of profit and is distributed among the members based on hours worked, seniority, or other criteria. In a worker cooperative, workers own their jobs, and therefore have a direct stake in the local environment and the power to conduct business in ways that benefit the community rather than destroying it. Some worker cooperatives maintain what is known as a “multiple bottom line”, evaluating success not merely in terms of net income, but also by factors like their sustainability as a business, their contribution to the community, and the happiness and longevity of their workers. [ ] 
 Worker-control can take many forms depending on the size and type of the business. Approaches to decision-making include: an elected board of directors, elected managers, management job roles, no management at all, consensus, majority vote, or combinations of the above. [ ] Participation in decision-making becomes the responsibility and privilege of each member. [ ] In one variation, workers usually invest money when they begin working. [ ] Each member owns one share, which provides its owner with one vote in company decision-making. While membership is not a requirement of employment, only employees can become members. [ ] 
 According to Kenneth W. Stikkers, the Mondragon cooperatives in the Basque region of Spain have achieved a previously unknown level of economic democracy. Established in  , Mondragon has since become an economic model that transcends the capitalist-socialist dichotomy and thereby helps us to imagine creative solutions to current economic problems. [ ] 
 Economist Richard D. Wolff argues that Mondragon is an example of "a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organization of production." [ ] 
 A consumers cooperative is owned by its customers for their mutual benefit . Oriented towards service rather than profit, consumers often provide capital to launch or purchase the enterprise. In practice, consumer cooperatives price goods and services at competitive market rates. The co-op returns profits to the consumer/owner according to a formula instead of paying a separate investor group. 
 In his book, From Mondragon To America , Greg MacLeod argues that "in consumer cooperatives where the customer-members own the capital and the employees are subject to capital, the normal dynamic is the adversarial relationship of labor to capital. Sometimes the result is strikes of labor against management." In some cooperatives, however, consumer/owners are workers as well. For example, Mondragon has developed a large "hybrid" cooperative which sells groceries and furniture in Spain. In this regard, MacLeod states: 
 "It is not necessary to opt for either the consumer or the producer but to link them both in one complex organization. The [Mondragon] founders have thereby shown that it is possible to devise a system that respects the rights of both producer and consumer, both sides of the economic question." [ ] 
 Consumer cooperatives are very different from "discount clubs," which charge annual fees in exchange for a discount on purchases. The club is not owned or governed by the members and profits go to investors, not to members. [ ] 
 Most food co-ops are consumer cooperatives that specialize in grocery products. Members patronize the store and vote in elections. The members elect a board of directors to make high-level decisions and recruit managers. [ ] Food cooperatives were originally established to provide fresh, organic produce as a viable alternative to packaged imports. The ideas of local and slow food production can help local farmers prosper, in addition to providing consumers with fresher products. But the growing ubiquity of organic food products in corporate stores testifies to broadening consumer awareness, and to the dynamics of global marketing. [ ] 
 Associated with national and international cooperative communities, Portland Oregon cooperatives manage to survive market competition with corporate franchise. As Lee Lancaster, financial manager for Food Front, states, "cooperatives are potentially one democratic economic model that could help guide business decisions toward meeting human needs while honoring the needs of society and nature". He admits, however, it is difficult to maintain collaboration among cooperatives while also avoiding integration that typically results in centralized authority. [ ] 
 Tim Calvert believes that dollars are the most important vote to make, and others tend to agree. Citing members of People’s Co-op [ ] and Alberta Cooperative Grocery, [ ] Romona DeNies of The Portland Alliance states, "Co-ops are the antidote to the centralization of power. People forget they have power as consumers to make choices. We can’t be completely disentangled from the corporate world, but we can try to provide a local model of living further from it. No one is getting rich off your money at a co-op. But that’s the economic value of shopping here. In return, you support a viable alternative to the vicious cycle of bottom lines and end profits". [ ] 
 As World Trade Organization representatives negotiate issues of competition, agricultural subsidies, and protectionism among developed nations, the American farmer resembles third-world farmers who must compete with subsidized agricultural giants like Monsanto Company . Lee Lancaster says, “Underneath our unique aspects, we have the same structure and principles. Welfare of our respective neighborhoods is of vital concern to us. Food co-ops were started to provide local, organic produce. Now with those things more mainstream, the demand is going up, and our share of that market is declining. We have to reevaluate." 
 Further, Lancaster claims that the traditional independence and decentralization of U.S. cooperatives have restricted their impact on the food industry through economies of scale . Proposing more collaboration, he asks: 
 "What if we could work with other co-ops to nurture and establish other cooperatives? In essence, this is an extension of neighborhood organizing. We’re all driven by competition from national chains, but in looking at national issues and realizing there’s a lot to address, what’s needed is a bigger movement, not a big corporation." [ ] 
 According to Thomas H. Greco, Jr. , author of New Money for Healthy Communities "The pinnacle of power in todays world is the power to issue money. If that power can be democratized and focused in a direction which gives social and ecological concerns top priority, then there may yet be hope for saving the world". In this regard, he recommended the regionalization of currencies. Cook suggested that "under the Bretton Woods system , the Federal Reserve acted as the worlds central bank. This gave America enormous leverage over economic policies of its principal trading partners". [ ] Cook claimed that developing nations were susceptible to exploitation mainly because they have no independent monetary system, using the U.S. dollar instead. This fed the fractional reserve banking system, operated by the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. Developing nations paid heavily for this service through market interest rates and because banking profits and property ownership emigrate to financial centers elsewhere. [ ] 
 According to Smith, "Currency is only the representation of wealth produced by combining land (resources), labor, and industrial capital". He claimed that no country was free when another country has such leverage over its entire economy. But by combining their resources, Smith claimed that developing nations have all three of these foundations of wealth: 
 By peripheral nations using the currency of an imperial center as its trading currency, the imperial center can actually print money to own industry within those periphery countries. By forming regional trading blocs and printing their own trading currency, the developing world has all four requirements for production, resources, labor, industrial capital, and finance capital. The wealth produced provides the value to back the created and circulating money. [ citation needed ] 
 Smith further explained that developed countries need resources from the developing world as much as developing countries need finance capital and technology from the developed world. Aside from the superior military power of the imperial centers, the undeveloped world actually has superior bargaining leverage. With independent trading currencies, developing countries could barter their resources to the developed world for the latest industrial technologies. Barter avoids "hard money monopolization" [ clarification needed ] and the unequal trade between weak and strong nations that result. Smith suggested that barter was how Germany resolved many financial difficulties "put in place to strangle her", and that "World Wars I and II settled that trade dispute". He claimed that their intentions of exclusive entitlement were clearly exposed when the imperial centers resorted to military force to prevent such barter and maintain monopoly control of others resources.

 Economic globalization is the increasing economic integration and interdependence of national, regional, and local economies across the world through an intensification of cross-border movement of goods, services, technologies and capital. [ ] Whereas globalization is a broad set of processes concerning multiple networks of economic, political, and cultural interchange, contemporary economic globalization is propelled by the rapid growing significance of information in all types of productive activities and marketization, and by developments in science and technology. [ ] 
 Economic globalization primarily comprises the globalization of production, finance, markets, technology, organizational regimes, institutions, corporations, and labour. [ ] While economic globalization has been expanding since the emergence of trans-national trade , it has grown at an increased rate over the last  –  years under the framework of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and World Trade Organization , which made countries gradually cut down trade barriers and open up their current accounts and capital accounts. [ ] This recent boom has been largely supported by developed economies integrating with majority world through foreign direct investment and lowering costs of doing business, the reduction of trade barriers , and in many cases cross border migration 
 While globalization has radically increased incomes and economic growth in developing countries and lowered consumer prices in developed countries, it also changes the power balance between developing and developed countries and affects the culture of each affected country. And the shifting location of goods production has caused many jobs to cross borders, requiring some workers in developed countries to change careers. [ ] 
 Economic globalization is one of the three main dimensions of globalization commonly found in academic literature, with the two other being political globalization and cultural globalization . [ ] 
 Beginning as early as   BCE, people were trading livestock, tools, and other items. In Sumer , an early civilization in Mesopotamia , a token system was one of the first forms of commodity money. [ ] Labor markets consist of workers, employers, wages, income, supply and demand. Labor markets have been around as long as commodity markets. The first labor markets provided workers to grow crops and tend livestock for later sale in local markets. Capital markets emerged in industries that required resources beyond those of an individual farmer. [ ] 
 By the early  s, it was rare [ dubious – discuss ] to come across a town that was not influenced by foreign markets—whether it be in labor, prices, or any other part of business. [ ] With advances in ship and rail transport and electronic communications, trade with other parts of the world became much easier. Towns were no longer limited to what they alone could produce and what nearby towns over could trade with them. 
 These advances in economic globalization were disrupted by World War I . Most of the global economic powers constructed protectionist economic policies and introduced trade barriers that slowed trade growth to the point of stagnation. [ ] This caused a slowing of world-wide trade and even led to other countries introducing immigration caps. [ ] Globalization didn’t fully resume until the  s, when governments began to emphasize the benefits of trade. [ ] Today, follow-on advances in technology have led to the rapid expansion of global trade. [ ] 
 Three suggested factors accelerated economic globalization: advancement of science and technology, market oriented economic reforms, and contributions by multinational corporations. [ ] 
 A reduction of transportation and communication costs were a key part of the growth of globalization. Since the  s, ocean shipping costs fell by half, airfreight by  %, and telecommunications by  %. 
 The GATT/WTO framework led participating countries to reduce their tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade. Governments shifted their economies from central planning to markets. These internal reforms allowed enterprises to adapt more quickly and exploit opportunities created by technology shifts. [ ] 
 Multinational corporations reorganized production to take advantage of these opportunities. Labor-intensive production migrated to areas with lower labor costs, later followed by other functions as skill levels increased. 
 The   invention of containerized shipping , increases in ship sizes were a major part of the reduction in shipping costs. [ ] [ ] 
 On   October  , the London Stock Exchange enacted newly deregulated rules that enabled global interconnection of markets , with an expectation of huge increases in market activity. This event came to be known as the Big Bang . 
 According to prominent Chinese economist Gao Shanguan, economic globalization is an irreversible trend due to the fact that world markets are in great need of science and information technologies. With the growing demands of science and technology, Shanquan states that with world markets take on an "increasing cross-border division of labor". [ ] 
 However, Princeton University professor Robert Gilpin argues that nations economic policies have mistakenly slowed their own growth by resisting globalization, showing that globalization is not irreversible. [ ] Antonio L. Rappa agrees that economic globalization is reversible and cites International Studies professor Peter J. Katzenstein . [ ] 
 Economic growth accelerated and poverty declined globally following the acceleration of globalization. 
 Per capita GDP growth in the post-  globalizers accelerated from  .  percent a year in the  s and  .  percent a year in the  s to  .  percent in the  s and  .  percent in the  s. This acceleration in growth is even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of  .  percent in the  s to  .  percent in the  s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries did much worse than the globalizers, with the formers annual growth rates falling from highs of  .  percent during the  s to only  .  percent during the  s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the  s and  s—  out of the   globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial." [ ] 
 Growth Rate of Real GDP per capita 
 According to the International Monetary Fund , growth benefits of economic globalization are widely shared. While several globalizers have seen an increase in inequality, most notably China, this increase in inequality is a result of domestic liberalization, restrictions on internal migration, and agricultural policies, rather than a result of international trade. [ ] 
 Poverty has been reduced as evidenced by a  .  percent annual growth in income for the poorest fifth of the population of Malaysia. Even in China, where inequality continues to be a problem, the poorest fifth of the population saw a  .  percent annual growth in income. In several countries, those living below the dollar-per-day poverty threshold declined. In China, the rate declined from   to   percent and in Bangladesh the rate dropped from   to   percent. [ ] 
 Globalizers are narrowing the per capita income gap between the rich and the globalizing nations. China, India, and Bangladesh, once among the poorest countries in the world, have greatly narrowed inequality due to their economic expansion. [ ] 
 The spread of multinational corporations which are business firms incorporated in one country that has production and sales operations in several other countries [ ] has accompanied the rise of globalization. One of the many changes they have brought to developing countries is increased automation, which may damage less-automated local firms and require their workers to develop new skills in order to transition into the changing economy, leaving some behind. The necessary education infrastructure is often not present, requiring a redirection of the government’s focus from social services to education. [ ] 
 ECLAC states that in order to create better economic relations globally, international lending agencies must work with developing countries to change how and where credit is concentrated as well as work towards accelerating financial development in developing countries. [ ] ECLAC further suggests that the United Nations expand its agenda to work more rigorously with international lending agencies and that they become more inclusive of all nations. Key factors in achieving universal competition is the spread of knowledge at the State level through education, training and technological advancements. [ ] Economist Jagdish Bhagwati suggested that programs to help developing countries adjust to the global economy would be beneficial for international economic relations. [ ] 
 Several movements, such as the fair trade movement and the anti-sweatshop movement , claim to promote a more socially just global economy. The fair trade movement works towards improving trade, development and production for disadvantaged producers. The fair trade movement has reached  .  billion US dollars in annual sales. [ ] The movement works to raise consumer awareness of exploitation of developing countries. Fair trade works under the motto of "trade, not aid", to improve the quality of life for farmers and merchants by participating in direct sales, providing better prices and supporting the community. [ ] Meanwhile,the anti-sweatshop movement is to protest the unfair treatment caused by some companies. Some global brands were found to do that before but they took some methods to support the labors soon after. The movement is taken to decrease the wrongdoing and gain the profits for labors. [ ] 
 The Argentine economic crisis of   caused in a currency devaluation and capital flight which resulted in a sharp drop in imports. 
 Capital flight occurs when assets or money rapidly flow out of a country because of that countrys recent increase in unfavorable financial conditions such as taxes , tariffs , labor costs , government debt or capital controls . This is usually accompanied by a sharp drop in the exchange rate of the affected country or a forced devaluation for countries living under fixed exchange rates . Currency declines improve the terms of trade , but reduce the monetary value of financial and other assets in the country. This leads to decreases in the purchasing power of the countrys assets. 
 A   paper published by Global Financial Integrity estimated capital flight, also called illicit financial flows to be leaving developing countries at the rate of "$  billion to $  trillion a year." [ ] But capital flight also affects developed countries. A   article in The Times reported that hundreds of wealthy financiers and entrepreneurs had recently fled the United Kingdom in response to recent tax increases, relocating to low tax destinations such as Jersey , Guernsey , the Isle of Man and the British Virgin Islands . [ ] In May   the scale of Greek capital flight in the wake of the first "undecided" legislative election was estimated at €  billion a week. [ ] 
 Capital flight can cause liquidity crises in directly affected countries and can cause related difficulties in other countries involved in international commerce such as shipping and finance. Asset holders may be forced into distress sales. Borrowers typically face higher loan costs and collateral requirements, compared to periods of ample liquidity, and unsecured debt is nearly impossible to obtain. Typically, during a liquidity crisis, the interbank lending market stalls. 
 While within-country income inequality has increased throughout the globalization period, globally inequality has lessened as developing countries have experienced much more rapid growth. [ ] Economic inequality varies between societies, historical periods, economic structures or economic systems, ongoing or past wars, between genders , and between differences in individuals abilities to create wealth . [ ] Among the various numerical indices for measuring economic inequality, the Gini coefficient is most often-cited. 
 Of the factors influencing the duration of economic growth in both developed and developing countries, income equality has a more beneficial effect than trade openness, sound political institutions, and foreign investment. [ ] 
 Economic inequality affects equity , equality of outcome and subsequent equality of opportunity . Although earlier studies considered economic inequality as necessary and beneficial, [ ] some economists see it as an important social problem. [ ] Early studies suggesting that greater equality inhibits economic growth did not account for lags between inequality changes and growth changes. [ ] Later studies claimed that one of the most robust determinants of sustained economic growth is the level of income inequality. [ ] 
 International inequality is inequality between countries. Income differences between rich and poor countries are very large, although they are changing rapidly. Per capita incomes in China and India doubled in the prior twenty years, a feat that required   years in the US. [ ] According to the United Nations Human Development Report for  , for countries at varying levels of the UN Human Development Index the GNP per capita grew between   and   from  ,  to  ,  or  % (very high human development),  ,  to  ,  or  % (medium) and  ,  to  ,  or  % (low) PPP$, respectively (PPP$ = purchasing power parity measured in United States dollars ). [ ] 
 Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising welfare and hence, reduced inequality. According to Martin Wolf , in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after   and infant mortality rate declined from   per thousand in   to   in   due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from  % in   to  % in   and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in fertility rates in the developing world as a whole from  .  births per woman in   to  .  in   indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment. [ ] Consequentially, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor . Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole. 
 The ratio of German assets in tax havens in relation to the total German GDP. [ ] The "Big  " shown are Hong Kong, Ireland, Lebanon, Liberia, Panama, Singapore, and Switzerland. 
 A tax haven is a state, country or territory where certain taxes are levied at a low rate or not at all, which are used by businesses for tax avoidance and tax evasion . [ ] Individuals and/or corporate entities can find it attractive to move themselves to areas with reduced taxation. This creates a situation of tax competition among governments. Taxes vary substantially across jurisdictions . [ ] Sovereign states have theoretically unlimited powers to enact tax laws affecting their territories, unless limited by previous international treaties. The central feature of a tax haven is that its laws and other measures can be used to evade or avoid the tax laws or regulations of other jurisdictions. [ ] In its December   report on the use of tax havens by American corporations, [ ] the U.S. Government Accountability Office was unable to provide a satisfactory definition of a tax haven, but regarded the following characteristics as indicative of it: nil or nominal taxes; lack of effective exchange of tax information with foreign tax authorities; lack of transparency in the operation of legislative, legal or administrative provisions; no requirement for a substantive local presence; and self-promotion as an offshore financial center . 
 A   report from the Tax Justice Network estimated that between USD $  trillion and $  trillion is sheltered from taxes in tax havens worldwide. [ ] If such hidden offshore assets are considered, many countries with governments nominally in debt would be net creditor nations. [ ] However, the tax policy director of the Chartered Institute of Taxation expressed skepticism over the accuracy of the figures. [ ] Daniel J. Mitchell of the US-based Cato Institute says that the report also assumes, when considering notional lost tax revenue, that  % of the money deposited offshore is evading payment of tax. [ ] 
 The tax shelter benefits result in a tax incidence disadvantaging the poor. [ ] Many tax havens are thought to have connections to "fraud, money laundering and terrorism." [ ] Ongoing investigations of illegal tax haven abuse have produced few convictions. [ ] [ ] Accountants  opinions on the propriety of tax havens have been evolving, [ ] as have the opinions of their corporate users, [ ] governments, [ ] [ ] and politicians, [ ] [ ] although their use by Fortune   companies [ ] and others remains widespread. [ ] Reform proposals centering on the Big Four accountancy firms have been advanced. [ ] Some governments appear to be using computer spyware to scrutinize corporations finances. [ ] 
 Red: U.S. corporate profits after tax. Blue: U.S. nonresidential business investment, both as fractions of GDP,  - . Wealth concentration of corporate profits in global tax havens due to tax avoidance spurred by imposition of austerity measures can stall investment, inhibiting further growth. [ ] 
 As a developing country,China firmly supports globalization and multilateral trade mechanism as a major channel to boost global economic development and opposes all forms of protectionism. China has always upheld the concept of mutual benefits and win-win results and is willing to jointly work with all parties to promote the construction of the Belt and Road initiative through consultation to meet the interests of all, so as to provide new stimulus to global economic growth and regional economic cooperation. [ ] 
 Economic globalization may affect culture. Populations may mimic the international flow of capital and labor markets in the form of immigration and the merger of cultures. Foreign resources and economic measures may affect different native cultures and may cause assimilation of a native people. [ ] As these populations are exposed to the English language, computers, western music, and North American culture, changes are being noted in shrinking family size, immigration to larger cities, more casual dating practices, and gender roles are transformed. 
 Yu Xintian noted two contrary trends in culture due to economic globalization. [ ] Yu argued that culture and industry not only flow from the developed world to the rest, but trigger an effort to protect local cultures. He notes that economic globalization began after World War II, whereas internationalization began over a century ago. [ ] 
 George Ritzer wrote about the McDonaldization of society and how fast food businesses spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world, attracting other places to adopt fast food culture . [ ] Ritzer describes other businesses such as The Body Shop , a British cosmetics company, that have copied McDonalds business model for expansion and influence. In  ,   of   or over  % of new McDonalds opened outside the US. In  , Japan had  ,  McDonalds locations. [ ] 
 Global media companies export information around the world. This creates a mostly one-way flow of information, and exposure to mostly western products and values. Companies like CNN , Reuters and the BBC dominate the global airwaves with western points of view. Other media news companies such as Qatar s Al Jazeera network offer a different point of view, but reach and influence fewer people. [ ] 
 "With an estimated   million people living outside their country of origin (International Labour Organization [ILO]  ), international migration has touched the lives of almost everyone in both the sending and receiving countries of the Global South and the Global North". [ ] Because of advances made in technology, human beings as well as goods are able to move through different countries and regions with relative ease. 
 "The geography of contemporary globalization is related closely to the history of colonialism and imperialism even if this is not usually made explicit in globalization theory". [ ] Colonialism created links between various societies across the world that encouraged some people to leave their original countries to work in another country. "Globalization theories have, by and large, neglected race and ethnicity in their accounts of the making of the new global order". [ ] "International migrants facilitate globalization processes by linking together disparate peoples and places into an increasingly single, shared global political-economic context [ ] [ ] [ ] Those who are not separated from their families still have a desire to migrate because "knowledge of living standards and social conditions across countries has become increasingly more available, especially through travel; both the real and symbolic reduction of time and distance have created powerful incentives for people to move". [ ] This affects women the most because "from a gender perspective, we have witnessed the feminization of most migration flows, especially since the  s, with profound transformations in the structure of families and gender roles in the international division of labor". [ ] Another reason for individuals to migrate is to make more money. Incomes in developed countries are far higher than in developing countries.

 Economics is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production , distribution , and consumption of goods and services . The term economics comes from the Ancient Greek οἰκονομία from οἶκος ( oikos , "house") and νόμος ( nomos , "custom" or "law"), hence "rules of the house (hold for good management)". [ ]  Political economy  was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late  th century suggested "economics" as a shorter term for "economic science" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences. [ ] 
 Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. Consistent with this focus, primary textbooks often distinguish between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics examines the behaviour of basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets , their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyses the entire economy (meaning aggregated production, consumption, savings, and investment) and issues affecting it, including unemployment of resources (labour, capital, and land), inflation, economic growth, and the public policies that address these issues (monetary, fiscal, and other policies). 
 Besides the traditional concern in production, distribution, and consumption in an economy, economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business , finance , health care , and government. Economic analyses may also be applied to such diverse subjects as crime, [ ] education , [ ] the family , law , politics , religion , [ ] social institutions , war, [ ] science , [ ] and the environment . [ ] Education, for example, requires time, effort, and expenses, plus the foregone income and experience, yet these losses can be weighted against future benefits education may bring to the agent or the economy. At the turn of the  st century, the expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism . [ ] The ultimate goal of economics is to improve the living conditions of people in their everyday life. [ ]

 Definitions 
 A map of world economies by size of GDP (nominal) in USD, World Bank ,  . [ ] 
 There are a variety of modern definitions of economics . Some of the differences may reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. [ ] Scottish philosopher Adam Smith ( ) defined what was then called political economy as "an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations", in particular as: 
 a branch of the science of a statesman or legislator [with the twofold objectives of providing] a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people ... [and] to supply the state or commonwealth with a revenue for the publick services. [ ] 
 The science which traces the laws of such of the phenomena of society as arise from the combined operations of mankind for the production of wealth, in so far as those phenomena are not modified by the pursuit of any other object. [ ] 
 Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man. [ ] 
 Lionel Robbins ( ) developed implications of what has been termed "[p]erhaps the most commonly accepted current definition of the subject": [ ] 
 Economics is a science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses. [ ] 
 Robbins describes the definition as not classificatory in "pick[ing] out certain kinds of behaviour" but rather analytical in "focus[ing] attention on a particular aspect of behaviour, the form imposed by the influence of scarcity ." [ ] He affirmed that previous economists have usually centred their studies on the analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow. [ ] But he said that economics can be used to study other things, such as war, that are outside its usual focus. This is because war has as the goal winning it (as a sought after end ), generates both cost and benefits; and, resources (human life and other costs) are used to attain the goal. If the war is not winnable or if the expected costs outweigh the benefits, the deciding actors (assuming they are rational) may never go to war (a decision ) but rather explore other alternatives. We cannot define economics as the science that studies wealth, war, crime, education, and any other field economic analysis can be applied to; but, as the science that studies a particular common aspect of each of those subjects (they all use scarce resources to attain a sought after end). 
 Some subsequent comments criticized the definition as overly broad in failing to limit its subject matter to analysis of markets. From the  s, however, such comments abated as the economic theory of maximizing behaviour and rational-choice modelling expanded the domain of the subject to areas previously treated in other fields. [ ] There are other criticisms as well, such as in scarcity not accounting for the macroeconomics of high unemployment. [ ] 
 Gary Becker , a contributor to the expansion of economics into new areas, describes the approach he favours as "combin[ing the] assumptions of maximizing behaviour, stable preferences , and market equilibrium , used relentlessly and unflinchingly." [ ] One commentary characterizes the remark as making economics an approach rather than a subject matter but with great specificity as to the "choice process and the type of social interaction that [such] analysis involves." The same source reviews a range of definitions included in principles of economics textbooks and concludes that the lack of agreement need not affect the subject-matter that the texts treat. Among economists more generally, it argues that a particular definition presented may reflect the direction toward which the author believes economics is evolving, or should evolve. [ ] 
 Microeconomics 
 Markets 
 Economists study trade, production and consumption decisions, such as those that occur in a traditional marketplace . 
 Microeconomics examines how entities, forming a market structure , interact within a market to create a market system . These entities include private and public players with various classifications, typically operating under scarcity of tradable units and government regulation . The item traded may be a tangible product such as apples or a service such as repair services, legal counsel, or entertainment. 
 In theory, in a free market the aggregates (sum of) of quantity demanded by buyers and quantity supplied by sellers will be equal and reach economic equilibrium over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached may not necessarily be morally equitable . For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by external factors , the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it. 
 Various market structures exist. In perfectly competitive markets , no participants are large enough to have the market power to set the price of a homogeneous product. In other words, every participant is a "price taker" as no participant influences the price of a product. In the real world, markets often experience imperfect competition . 
 Forms include monopoly (in which there is only one seller of a good), duopoly (in which there are only two sellers of a good), oligopoly (in which there are few sellers of a good), monopolistic competition (in which there are many sellers producing highly differentiated goods), monopsony (in which there is only one buyer of a good), and oligopsony (in which there are few buyers of a good). Unlike perfect competition, imperfect competition invariably means market power is unequally distributed. Firms under imperfect competition have the potential to be "price makers", which means that, by holding a disproportionately high share of market power, they can influence the prices of their products. 
 Microeconomics studies individual markets by simplifying the economic system by assuming that activity in the market being analysed does not affect other markets. This method of analysis is known as partial-equilibrium analysis (supply and demand). This method aggregates (the sum of all activity) in only one market. General-equilibrium theory studies various markets and their behaviour. It aggregates (the sum of all activity) across all markets. This method studies both changes in markets and their interactions leading towards equilibrium. [ ] 
 Production, cost, and efficiency 
 In microeconomics, production is the conversion of inputs into outputs . It is an economic process that uses inputs to create a commodity or a service for exchange or direct use. Production is a flow and thus a rate of output per period of time. Distinctions include such production alternatives as for consumption (food, haircuts, etc.) vs. investment goods (new tractors, buildings, roads, etc.), public goods (national defence, smallpox vaccinations, etc.) or private goods (new computers, bananas, etc.), and "guns" vs "butter" . 
 Opportunity cost refers to the economic cost of production: the value of the next best opportunity foregone. Choices must be made between desirable yet mutually exclusive actions. It has been described as expressing "the basic relationship between scarcity and choice ". [ ] For example, if a baker uses a sack of flour to make pretzels one morning, then the baker cannot use either the flour or the morning to make bagels instead. Part of the cost of making pretzels is that neither the flour nor the morning are available any longer, for use in some other way. The opportunity cost of an activity is an element in ensuring that scarce resources are used efficiently, such that the cost is weighed against the value of that activity in deciding on more or less of it. Opportunity costs are not restricted to monetary or financial costs but could be measured by the real cost of output forgone , leisure , or anything else that provides the alternative benefit ( utility ). [ ] 
 Inputs used in the production process include such primary factors of production as labour services , capital (durable produced goods used in production, such as an existing factory), and land (including natural resources). Other inputs may include intermediate goods used in production of final goods, such as the steel in a new car. 
 Economic efficiency describes how well a system generates desired output with a given set of inputs and available technology . Efficiency is improved if more output is generated without changing inputs, or in other words, the amount of "waste" is reduced. A widely accepted general standard is Pareto efficiency , which is reached when no further change can make someone better off without making someone else worse off. 
 The production–possibility frontier (PPF) is an expository figure for representing scarcity, cost, and efficiency. In the simplest case an economy can produce just two goods (say "guns" and "butter"). The PPF is a table or graph (as at the right) showing the different quantity combinations of the two goods producible with a given technology and total factor inputs, which limit feasible total output. Each point on the curve shows potential total output for the economy, which is the maximum feasible output of one good, given a feasible output quantity of the other good. 
 Scarcity is represented in the figure by people being willing but unable in the aggregate to consume beyond the PPF (such as at X ) and by the negative slope of the curve. [ ] If production of one good increases along the curve, production of the other good decreases , an inverse relationship . This is because increasing output of one good requires transferring inputs to it from production of the other good, decreasing the latter. 
 The slope of the curve at a point on it gives the trade-off between the two goods. It measures what an additional unit of one good costs in units forgone of the other good, an example of a real opportunity cost . Thus, if one more Gun costs   units of butter, the opportunity cost of one Gun is   Butter. Along the PPF , scarcity implies that choosing more of one good in the aggregate entails doing with less of the other good. Still, in a market economy , movement along the curve may indicate that the choice of the increased output is anticipated to be worth the cost to the agents. 
 By construction, each point on the curve shows productive efficiency in maximizing output for given total inputs. A point inside the curve (as at A ), is feasible but represents production inefficiency (wasteful use of inputs), in that output of one or both goods could increase by moving in a northeast direction to a point on the curve. Examples cited of such inefficiency include high unemployment during a business-cycle recession or economic organization of a country that discourages full use of resources. Being on the curve might still not fully satisfy allocative efficiency (also called Pareto efficiency ) if it does not produce a mix of goods that consumers prefer over other points. 
 Much applied economics in public policy is concerned with determining how the efficiency of an economy can be improved. Recognizing the reality of scarcity and then figuring out how to organize society for the most efficient use of resources has been described as the "essence of economics", where the subject "makes its unique contribution." [ ] 
 Specialization 
 Specialization is considered key to economic efficiency based on theoretical and empirical considerations. Different individuals or nations may have different real opportunity costs of production, say from differences in stocks of human capital per worker or capital / labour ratios. According to theory, this may give a comparative advantage in production of goods that make more intensive use of the relatively more abundant, thus relatively cheaper, input. 
 Even if one region has an absolute advantage as to the ratio of its outputs to inputs in every type of output, it may still specialize in the output in which it has a comparative advantage and thereby gain from trading with a region that lacks any absolute advantage but has a comparative advantage in producing something else. 
 It has been observed that a high volume of trade occurs among regions even with access to a similar technology and mix of factor inputs, including high-income countries. This has led to investigation of economies of scale and agglomeration to explain specialization in similar but differentiated product lines, to the overall benefit of respective trading parties or regions. [ ] 
 The general theory of specialization applies to trade among individuals, farms, manufacturers, service providers, and economies . Among each of these production systems, there may be a corresponding division of labour with different work groups specializing, or correspondingly different types of capital equipment and differentiated land uses. [ ] 
 An example that combines features above is a country that specializes in the production of high-tech knowledge products, as developed countries do, and trades with developing nations for goods produced in factories where labour is relatively cheap and plentiful, resulting in different in opportunity costs of production. More total output and utility thereby results from specializing in production and trading than if each country produced its own high-tech and low-tech products. 
 Theory and observation set out the conditions such that market prices of outputs and productive inputs select an allocation of factor inputs by comparative advantage, so that (relatively) low-cost inputs go to producing low-cost outputs. In the process, aggregate output may increase as a by-product or by design . [ ] Such specialization of production creates opportunities for gains from trade whereby resource owners benefit from trade in the sale of one type of output for other, more highly valued goods. A measure of gains from trade is the increased income levels that trade may facilitate. [ ] 
 Supply and demand 
 The supply and demand model describes how prices vary as a result of a balance between product availability and demand. The graph depicts an increase (that is, right-shift) in demand from D   to D   along with the consequent increase in price and quantity required to reach a new equilibrium point on the supply curve (S). 
 Prices and quantities have been described as the most directly observable attributes of goods produced and exchanged in a market economy . [ ] The theory of supply and demand is an organizing principle for explaining how prices coordinate the amounts produced and consumed. In microeconomics , it applies to price and output determination for a market with perfect competition , which includes the condition of no buyers or sellers large enough to have price-setting power . 
 For a given market of a commodity , demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good. Demand is often represented by a table or a graph showing price and quantity demanded (as in the figure). Demand theory describes individual consumers as rationally choosing the most preferred quantity of each good, given income, prices, tastes, etc. A term for this is "constrained utility maximization" (with income and wealth as the constraints on demand). Here, utility refers to the hypothesized relation of each individual consumer for ranking different commodity bundles as more or less preferred. 
 The law of demand states that, in general, price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. That is, the higher the price of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy (other things unchanged ). As the price of a commodity falls, consumers move toward it from relatively more expensive goods (the substitution effect ). In addition, purchasing power from the price decline increases ability to buy (the income effect ). Other factors can change demand; for example an increase in income will shift the demand curve for a normal good outward relative to the origin, as in the figure. All determinants are predominantly taken as constant factors of demand and supply. 
 Supply is the relation between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit-maximizers , meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged. 
 That is, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it producers will supply, as in the figure. The higher price makes it profitable to increase production. Just as on the demand side, the position of the supply can shift, say from a change in the price of a productive input or a technical improvement. The "Law of Supply" states that, in general, a rise in price leads to an expansion in supply and a fall in price leads to a contraction in supply. Here as well, the determinants of supply, such as price of substitutes, cost of production, technology applied and various factors inputs of production are all taken to be constant for a specific time period of evaluation of supply. 
 Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, the intersection of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, there is a shortage of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of quantity supplied compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes quantity supplied equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply. 
 For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility , to consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit. [ ] The corresponding point on the supply curve measures marginal cost , the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of the good. The price in equilibrium is determined by supply and demand. In a perfectly competitive market , supply and demand equate marginal cost and marginal utility at equilibrium. [ ] 
 On the supply side of the market, some factors of production are described as (relatively) variable in the short run , which affects the cost of changing output levels. Their usage rates can be changed easily, such as electrical power, raw-material inputs, and over-time and temp work. Other inputs are relatively fixed , such as plant and equipment and key personnel. In the long run , all inputs may be adjusted by management . These distinctions translate to differences in the elasticity (responsiveness) of the supply curve in the short and long runs and corresponding differences in the price-quantity change from a shift on the supply or demand side of the market. 
 Marginalist theory , such as above, describes the consumers as attempting to reach most-preferred positions, subject to income and wealth constraints while producers attempt to maximize profits subject to their own constraints, including demand for goods produced, technology, and the price of inputs. For the consumer, that point comes where marginal utility of a good, net of price, reaches zero, leaving no net gain from further consumption increases. Analogously, the producer compares marginal revenue (identical to price for the perfect competitor) against the marginal cost of a good, with marginal profit the difference. At the point where marginal profit reaches zero, further increases in production of the good stop. For movement to market equilibrium and for changes in equilibrium, price and quantity also change "at the margin": more-or-less of something, rather than necessarily all-or-nothing. 
 Other applications of demand and supply include the distribution of income among the factors of production , including labour and capital, through factor markets. In a competitive labour market for example the quantity of labour employed and the price of labour (the wage rate) depends on the demand for labour (from employers for production) and supply of labour (from potential workers). Labour economics examines the interaction of workers and employers through such markets to explain patterns and changes of wages and other labour income, labour mobility , and (un)employment, productivity through human capital , and related public-policy issues. [ ] 
 Demand-and-supply analysis is used to explain the behaviour of perfectly competitive markets, but as a standard of comparison it can be extended to any type of market. It can also be generalized to explain variables across the economy , for example, total output (estimated as real GDP ) and the general price level , as studied in macroeconomics . [ ] Tracing the qualitative and quantitative effects of variables that change supply and demand, whether in the short or long run, is a standard exercise in applied economics . Economic theory may also specify conditions such that supply and demand through the market is an efficient mechanism for allocating resources. [ ] 
 Firms 
 People frequently do not trade directly on markets. Instead, on the supply side, they may work in and produce through firms . The most obvious kinds of firms are corporations , partnerships and trusts . According to Ronald Coase , people begin to organize their production in firms when the costs of doing business becomes lower than doing it on the market. [ ] Firms combine labour and capital, and can achieve far greater economies of scale (when the average cost per unit declines as more units are produced) than individual market trading. 
 In perfectly competitive markets studied in the theory of supply and demand, there are many producers, none of which significantly influence price. Industrial organization generalizes from that special case to study the strategic behaviour of firms that do have significant control of price. It considers the structure of such markets and their interactions. Common market structures studied besides perfect competition include monopolistic competition , various forms of oligopoly , and monopoly . [ ] 
 Managerial economics applies microeconomic analysis to specific decisions in business firms or other management units. It draws heavily from quantitative methods such as operations research and programming and from statistical methods such as regression analysis in the absence of certainty and perfect knowledge. A unifying theme is the attempt to optimize business decisions, including unit-cost minimization and profit maximization, given the firms objectives and constraints imposed by technology and market conditions. [ ] 
 Uncertainty and game theory 
 Uncertainty in economics is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether quantifiable as risk or not. Without it, household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange of a single instrument in each market period, and there would be no communications industry. [ ] Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents responses to it. [ ] 
 Game theory is a branch of applied mathematics that considers strategic interactions between agents, one kind of uncertainty. It provides a mathematical foundation of industrial organization , discussed above, to model different types of firm behaviour, for example in an oligopolistic industry (few sellers), but equally applicable to wage negotiations, bargaining , contract design , and any situation where individual agents are few enough to have perceptible effects on each other. As a method heavily used in behavioural economics , it postulates that agents choose strategies to maximize their payoffs, given the strategies of other agents with at least partially conflicting interests. [ ] [ ] 
 Some market organizations may give rise to inefficiencies associated with uncertainty. Based on George Akerlof s " Market for Lemons " article, the paradigm example is of a dodgy second-hand car market. Customers without knowledge of whether a car is a "lemon" depress its price below what a quality second-hand car would be. [ ] Information asymmetry arises here, if the seller has more relevant information than the buyer but no incentive to disclose it. Related problems in insurance are adverse selection , such that those at most risk are most likely to insure (say reckless drivers), and moral hazard , such that insurance results in riskier behaviour (say more reckless driving). [ ] 
 Both problems may raise insurance costs and reduce efficiency by driving otherwise willing transactors from the market (" incomplete markets "). Moreover, attempting to reduce one problem, say adverse selection by mandating insurance, may add to another, say moral hazard. Information economics , which studies such problems, has relevance in subjects such as insurance, contract law , mechanism design , monetary economics , and health care . [ ] Applied subjects include market and legal remedies to spread or reduce risk, such as warranties, government-mandated partial insurance, restructuring or bankruptcy law , inspection, and regulation for quality and information disclosure. [ ] [ ] 
 Market failure 
 Pollution can be a simple example of market failure. If costs of production are not borne by producers but are by the environment, accident victims or others, then prices are distorted. 
 The term " market failure " encompasses several problems which may undermine standard economic assumptions. Although economists categorize market failures differently, the following categories emerge in the main texts. [ ] 
 Information asymmetries and incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies, as discussed above. 
 Natural monopoly , or the overlapping concepts of "practical" and "technical" monopoly, is an extreme case of failure of competition as a restraint on producers. Extreme economies of scale are one possible cause. 
 Public goods are goods which are undersupplied in a typical market. The defining features are that people can consume public goods without having to pay for them and that more than one person can consume the good at the same time. 
 Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative externalities and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities in an effort to correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. [ ] Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply. [ ] 
 In many areas, some form of price stickiness is postulated to account for quantities, rather than prices, adjusting in the short run to changes on the demand side or the supply side. This includes standard analysis of the business cycle in macroeconomics . Analysis often revolves around causes of such price stickiness and their implications for reaching a hypothesized long-run equilibrium. Examples of such price stickiness in particular markets include wage rates in labour markets and posted prices in markets deviating from perfect competition . 
 Policy options include regulations that reflect cost-benefit analysis or market solutions that change incentives, such as emission fees or redefinition of property rights. [ ] 
 Public sector 
 Public finance is the field of economics that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence (who really pays a particular tax), cost-benefit analysis of government programmes, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory , models public-sector behaviour analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats. [ ] 
 Much of economics is positive , seeking to describe and predict economic phenomena. Normative economics seeks to identify what economies ought to be like. 
 Welfare economics is a normative branch of economics that uses microeconomic techniques to simultaneously determine the allocative efficiency within an economy and the income distribution associated with it. It attempts to measure social welfare by examining the economic activities of the individuals that comprise society. [ ] 
 Macroeconomics 
 The circulation of money in an economy in a macroeconomic model. 
 Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole to explain broad aggregates and their interactions "top down", that is, using a simplified form of general-equilibrium theory. [ ] Such aggregates include national income and output , the unemployment rate , and price inflation and subaggregates like total consumption and investment spending and their components. It also studies effects of monetary policy and fiscal policy . 
 Since at least the  s, macroeconomics has been characterized by further integration as to micro-based modelling of sectors, including rationality of players, efficient use of market information, and imperfect competition . [ ] This has addressed a long-standing concern about inconsistent developments of the same subject. [ ] 
 Macroeconomic analysis also considers factors affecting the long-term level and growth of national income. Such factors include capital accumulation, technological change and labour force growth. [ ] 
 Growth 
 Growth economics studies factors that explain economic growth – the increase in output per capita of a country over a long period of time. The same factors are used to explain differences in the level of output per capita between countries, in particular why some countries grow faster than others, and whether countries converge at the same rates of growth. 
 He therefore advocated active policy responses by the public sector , including monetary policy actions by the central bank and fiscal policy actions by the government to stabilize output over the business cycle . [ ] Thus, a central conclusion of Keynesian economics is that, in some situations, no strong automatic mechanism moves output and employment towards full employment levels. John Hicks  IS/LM model has been the most influential interpretation of The General Theory . 
 Over the years, understanding of the business cycle has branched into various research programmes , mostly related to or distinct from Keynesianism. The neoclassical synthesis refers to the reconciliation of Keynesian economics with neoclassical economics , stating that Keynesianism is correct in the short run but qualified by neoclassical-like considerations in the intermediate and long run . [ ] 
 In contrast, the new Keynesian approach retains the rational expectations assumption, however it assumes a variety of market failures . In particular, New Keynesians assume prices and wages are " sticky ", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions. [ ] 
 Thus, the new classicals assume that prices and wages adjust automatically to attain full employment, whereas the new Keynesians see full employment as being automatically achieved only in the long run, and hence government and central-bank policies are needed because the "long run" may be very long. 
 Unemployment 
 The amount of unemployment in an economy is measured by the unemployment rate, the percentage of workers without jobs in the labour force. The labour force only includes workers actively looking for jobs. People who are retired, pursuing education, or discouraged from seeking work by a lack of job prospects are excluded from the labour force. Unemployment can be generally broken down into several types that are related to different causes. [ ] 
 Classical models of unemployment occurs when wages are too high for employers to be willing to hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical unemployment, frictional unemployment occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of unemployment. [ ] 
 Structural unemployment covers a variety of possible causes of unemployment including a mismatch between workers skills and the skills required for open jobs. [ ] Large amounts of structural unemployment can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills are no longer in demand. Structural unemployment is similar to frictional unemployment since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural unemployment covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process. [ ] 
 While some types of unemployment may occur regardless of the condition of the economy, cyclical unemployment occurs when growth stagnates. Okuns law represents the empirical relationship between unemployment and economic growth. [ ] The original version of Okuns law states that a  % increase in output would lead to a  % decrease in unemployment. [ ] 
 Inflation and monetary policy 
 Money is a means of final payment for goods in most price system economies and the unit of account in which prices are typically stated. An apt statement by Francis Amasa Walker , a well-known economist is, "Money is what money does." [ citation needed ] Money has a general acceptability, a relative consistency in value, divisibility, durability, portability, elastic in supply and survives with mass public confidence. It includes currency held by the nonbank public and checkable deposits. It has been described as a social convention, like language, useful to one largely because it is useful to others. 
 As a medium of exchange , money facilitates trade. It is essentially a measure of value and more importantly, a store of value being a basis for credit creation. Its economic function can be contrasted with barter (non-monetary exchange). Given a diverse array of produced goods and specialized producers, barter may entail a hard-to-locate double coincidence of wants as to what is exchanged, say apples and a book. Money can reduce the transaction cost of exchange because of its ready acceptability. Then it is less costly for the seller to accept money in exchange, rather than what the buyer produces. [ ] 
 Fiscal policy 
 Governments implement fiscal policy that influence macroeconomic conditions by adjusting spending and taxation policies to alter aggregate demand. When aggregate demand falls below the potential output of the economy, there is an output gap where some productive capacity is left unemployed. Governments increase spending and cut taxes to boost aggregate demand. Resources that have been idled can be used by the government. 
 For example, unemployed home builders can be hired to expand highways. Tax cuts allow consumers to increase their spending, which boosts aggregate demand. Both tax cuts and spending have multiplier effects where the initial increase in demand from the policy percolates through the economy and generates additional economic activity. 
 The effects of fiscal policy can be limited by crowding out . When there is no output gap, the economy is producing at full capacity and there are no excess productive resources. If the government increases spending in this situation, the government use resources that otherwise would have been used by the private sector, so there is no increase in overall output. Some economists think that crowding out is always an issue while others do not think it is a major issue when output is depressed. 
 Sceptics of fiscal policy also make the argument of Ricardian equivalence . They argue that an increase in debt will have to be paid for with future tax increases, which will cause people to reduce their consumption and save money to pay for the future tax increase. Under Ricardian equivalence, any boost in demand from fiscal policy will be offset by the increased savings rate intended to pay for future higher taxes. 
 International economics 
 List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita in  . 
 International trade studies determinants of goods-and-services flows across international boundaries. It also concerns the size and distribution of gains from trade . Policy applications include estimating the effects of changing tariff rates and trade quotas. International finance is a macroeconomic field which examines the flow of capital across international borders, and the effects of these movements on exchange rates . Increased trade in goods, services and capital between countries is a major effect of contemporary globalization . [ ] 
 Economic systems is the branch of economics that studies the methods and institutions by which societies determine the ownership, direction, and allocation of economic resources. An economic system of a society is the unit of analysis. 
 Among contemporary systems at different ends of the organizational spectrum are socialist systems and capitalist systems , in which most production occurs in respectively state-run and private enterprises. In between are mixed economies . A common element is the interaction of economic and political influences, broadly described as political economy . Comparative economic systems studies the relative performance and behaviour of different economies or systems. [ ] 
 Practice 
 Contemporary economics uses mathematics. Economists draw on the tools of calculus , linear algebra , statistics , game theory , and computer science . [ ] Professional economists are expected to be familiar with these tools, while a minority specialize in econometrics and mathematical methods. 
 Theory 
 Mainstream economic theory relies upon a priori quantitative economic models , which employ a variety of concepts. Theory typically proceeds with an assumption of ceteris paribus , which means holding constant explanatory variables other than the one under consideration. When creating theories, the objective is to find ones which are at least as simple in information requirements, more precise in predictions, and more fruitful in generating additional research than prior theories. [ ] 
 The aforementioned microeconomic concepts play a major part in macroeconomic models – for instance, in monetary theory , the quantity theory of money predicts that increases in the money supply increase inflation , and inflation is assumed to be influenced by rational expectations . In development economics , slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the Four Asian Tigers . Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only qualitative , not quantitative . [ ] 
 Expositions of economic reasoning often use two-dimensional graphs to illustrate theoretical relationships. At a higher level of generality, Paul Samuelson s treatise Foundations of Economic Analysis ( ) used mathematical methods to represent the theory, particularly as to maximizing behavioural relations of agents reaching equilibrium. The book focused on examining the class of statements called operationally meaningful theorems in economics, which are theorems that can conceivably be refuted by empirical data. [ ] 
 Empirical investigation 
 Economic theories are frequently tested empirically , largely through the use of econometrics using economic data . [ ] The controlled experiments common to the physical sciences are difficult and uncommon in economics, [ ] and instead broad data is observationally studied ; this type of testing is typically regarded as less rigorous than controlled experimentation, and the conclusions typically more tentative. However, the field of experimental economics is growing, and increasing use is being made of natural experiments . 
 Statistical methods such as regression analysis are common. Practitioners use such methods to estimate the size, economic significance, and statistical significance ("signal strength") of the hypothesized relation(s) and to adjust for noise from other variables. By such means, a hypothesis may gain acceptance, although in a probabilistic, rather than certain, sense. Acceptance is dependent upon the falsifiable hypothesis surviving tests. Use of commonly accepted methods need not produce a final conclusion or even a consensus on a particular question, given different tests, data sets , and prior beliefs. 
 Criticism based on professional standards and non- replicability of results serve as further checks against bias, errors, and over-generalization, [ ] [ ] although much economic research has been accused of being non-replicable, and prestigious journals have been accused of not facilitating replication through the provision of the code and data. [ ] Like theories, uses of test statistics are themselves open to critical analysis, [ ] although critical commentary on papers in economics in prestigious journals such as the American Economic Review has declined precipitously in the past   years. This has been attributed to journals incentives to maximize citations in order to rank higher on the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). [ ] 
 In applied economics, input-output models employing linear programming methods are quite common. Large amounts of data are run through computer programs to analyse the impact of certain policies; IMPLAN is one well-known example. 
 Experimental economics has promoted the use of scientifically controlled experiments . This has reduced long-noted distinction of economics from natural sciences allowed direct tests of what were previously taken as axioms. [ ] In some cases these have found that the axioms are not entirely correct; for example, the ultimatum game has revealed that people reject unequal offers. 
 Profession 
 The professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject, has been described as "the main change in economics since around  ". [ ] Most major universities and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject, whether in the liberal arts , business, or for professional study. 
 In the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including banking and finance . Economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national Treasury , Central Bank or Bureau of Statistics . 
 The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (commonly known as the Nobel Prize in Economics) is a prize awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions in the field. 
 Law and economics, or economic analysis of law, is an approach to legal theory that applies methods of economics to law. It includes the use of economic concepts to explain the effects of legal rules, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient , and to predict what the legal rules will be. [ ] A seminal article by Ronald Coase published in   suggested that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities . [ ] 
 Political economy is the interdisciplinary study that combines economics, law, and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system ( capitalist , socialist , mixed) influence each other. It studies questions such as how monopoly , rent-seeking behaviour, and externalities should impact government policy. [ ] Historians have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests. [ ] 
 A   painting of a French seaport during the heyday of mercantilism . 
 Two groups, later called "mercantilists" and "physiocrats", more directly influenced the subsequent development of the subject. Both groups were associated with the rise of economic nationalism and modern capitalism in Europe. Mercantilism was an economic doctrine that flourished from the  th to  th century in a prolific pamphlet literature, whether of merchants or statesmen. It held that a nations wealth depended on its accumulation of gold and silver. Nations without access to mines could obtain gold and silver from trade only by selling goods abroad and restricting imports other than of gold and silver. The doctrine called for importing cheap raw materials to be used in manufacturing goods, which could be exported, and for state regulation to impose protective tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and prohibit manufacturing in the colonies. [ ] 
 Physiocrats , a group of  th-century French thinkers and writers, developed the idea of the economy as a circular flow of income and output. Physiocrats believed that only agricultural production generated a clear surplus over cost, so that agriculture was the basis of all wealth. Thus, they opposed the mercantilist policy of promoting manufacturing and trade at the expense of agriculture, including import tariffs. Physiocrats advocated replacing administratively costly tax collections with a single tax on income of land owners. In reaction against copious mercantilist trade regulations, the physiocrats advocated a policy of laissez-faire , which called for minimal government intervention in the economy. [ ] 
 Adam Smith ( – ) was an early economic theorist. [ ] Smith was harshly critical of the mercantilists but described the physiocratic system "with all its imperfections" as "perhaps the purest approximation to the truth that has yet been published" on the subject. [ ] 
 Classical political economy 
 The publication of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations in   is considered to be the first formalisation of economic thought. 
 The publication of Adam Smith s The Wealth of Nations in  , has been described as "the effective birth of economics as a separate discipline." [ ] The book identified land, labour, and capital as the three factors of production and the major contributors to a nations wealth, as distinct from the Physiocratic idea that only agriculture was productive. 
 Smith discusses potential benefits of specialization by division of labour , including increased labour productivity and gains from trade , whether between town and country or across countries. [ ] His "theorem" that "the division of labor is limited by the extent of the market" has been described as the "core of a theory of the functions of firm and industry " and a "fundamental principle of economic organization." [ ] To Smith has also been ascribed "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics" and foundation of resource-allocation theory – that, under competition , resource owners (of labour, land, and capital) seek their most profitable uses, resulting in an equal rate of return for all uses in equilibrium (adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training and unemployment). [ ] 
 In an argument that includes "one of the most famous passages in all economics," [ ] Smith represents every individual as trying to employ any capital they might command for their own advantage, not that of the society, [ ] and for the sake of profit, which is necessary at some level for employing capital in domestic industry, and positively related to the value of produce. [ ] In this: 
 He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. [ ] 
 Economists have linked Smiths invisible-hand concept to his concern for the common man and woman through economic growth and development , [ ] enabling higher levels of consumption, which Smith describes as "the sole end and purpose of all production." [ ] [ ] He embeds the "invisible hand" in a framework that includes limiting restrictions on competition and foreign trade by government and industry in the same chapter [ ] and elsewhere regulation of banking and the interest rate, [ ] provision of a "natural system of liberty" — national defence, an egalitarian justice and legal system, and certain institutions and public works with general benefits to the whole society that might otherwise be unprofitable to produce, such as education [ ] and roads, canals, and the like. [ ] [ ] An influential introductory textbook includes parallel discussion and this assessment: "Above all, it is Adam Smiths vision of a self-regulating invisible hand that is his enduring contribution to modern economics." [ ] 
 The Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus ( ) used the concept of diminishing returns to explain low living standards. Human population , he argued, tended to increase geometrically, outstripping the production of food, which increased arithmetically. The force of a rapidly growing population against a limited amount of land meant diminishing returns to labour. The result, he claimed, was chronically low wages, which prevented the standard of living for most of the population from rising above the subsistence level. [ ] Economist Julian Lincoln Simon has criticized Malthuss conclusions. [ ] 
 While Adam Smith emphasized the production of income, David Ricardo ( ) focused on the distribution of income among landowners, workers, and capitalists. Ricardo saw an inherent conflict between landowners on the one hand and labour and capital on the other. He posited that the growth of population and capital, pressing against a fixed supply of land, pushes up rents and holds down wages and profits. Ricardo was the first to state and prove the principle of comparative advantage , according to which each country should specialize in producing and exporting goods in that it has a lower relative cost of production, rather relying only on its own production. [ ] It has been termed a "fundamental analytical explanation" for gains from trade . [ ] 
 Coming at the end of the Classical tradition, John Stuart Mill ( ) parted company with the earlier classical economists on the inevitability of the distribution of income produced by the market system. Mill pointed to a distinct difference between the markets two roles: allocation of resources and distribution of income. The market might be efficient in allocating resources but not in distributing income, he wrote, making it necessary for society to intervene. [ ] 
 Value theory was important in classical theory. Smith wrote that the "real price of every thing ... is the toil and trouble of acquiring it" as influenced by its scarcity. Smith maintained that, with rent and profit, other costs besides wages also enter the price of a commodity. [ ] Other classical economists presented variations on Smith, termed the  labour theory of value . Classical economics focused on the tendency of markets to move to long-run equilibrium. 
 Marxism 
 The Marxist school of economic thought comes from the work of German economist Karl Marx . 
 Marxist (later, Marxian) economics descends from classical economics. It derives from the work of Karl Marx . The first volume of Marxs major work, Das Kapital , was published in German in  . In it, Marx focused on the labour theory of value and the theory of surplus value which, he believed, explained the exploitation of labour by capital. [ ] The labour theory of value held that the value of an exchanged commodity was determined by the labour that went into its production and the theory of surplus value demonstrated how the workers only got paid a proportion of the value their work had created. [ ] 
 Neoclassical economics 
 At the dawn as a social science, economics was defined and discussed at length as the study of production, distribution, and consumption of wealth by Jean-Baptiste Say in his "Treatise on Political Economy or, The Production, Distribution, and Consumption of Wealth" ( ). These three items are considered by the science only in relation to the increase or diminution of wealth, and not in reference to their processes of execution. [ ] Says definition has prevailed up to our time, saved by substituting the word "wealth" for "goods and services" meaning that wealth may include non material objects as well. One hundred and thirty years later, Lionel Robbins noticed that this definition no longer sufficed, [ ] because many economists were making theoretical and philosophical inroads in other areas of human activity. In his Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science , he proposed a definition of economics as a study of a particular aspect of human behaviour, the one that falls under the influence of scarcity, [ ] which forces people to choose, allocate scarce resources to competing ends, and economize (seeking the greatest welfare while avoiding the wasting of scarce resources). For Robbins, the insufficiency was solved, and his definition allows us to proclaim, with an easy conscience, education economics, safety and security economics, health economics, war economics, and of course, production, distribution and consumption economics as valid subjects of the economic science. 
 Citing Robbins: "Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses". [ ] After discussing it for decades, Robbins definition became widely accepted by mainstream economists, and it has opened way into current textbooks. [ ] Although far from unanimous, most mainstream economists would accept some version of Robbins definition, even though many have raised serious objections to the scope and method of economics, emanating from that definition. [ ] Due to the lack of strong consensus, and that production, distribution and consumption of goods and services is the prime area of study of economics, the old definition still stands in many quarters. 
 A body of theory later termed "neoclassical economics" or " marginalism " formed from about   to  . The term "economics" was popularized by such neoclassical economists as Alfred Marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier " political economy ". [ ] This corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences . [ ] 
 Neoclassical economics systematized supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium, affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income. It dispensed with the labour theory of value inherited from classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side. [ ] In the  th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility , which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons. [ ] [ ] 
 In microeconomics , neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making . An immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices (as costs) and income affect quantity demanded. [ ] In macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with Keynesian macroeconomics. [ ] [ ] 
 Neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals , households , and organizations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents are assumed to act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a decision (choice) is made by one or more resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time they have to make and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society. [ ] They are the focus of economic analysis. [ ] 
 An approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows: 
 The continuous interplay (exchange or trade) done by economic actors in all markets sets the prices for all goods and services which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, in an economy, as well as the remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). [ ] Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system. [ ] [ ] 
 Keynesian economics 
 Keynesian economics derives from John Maynard Keynes , in particular his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money ( ), which ushered in contemporary macroeconomics as a distinct field. [ ] The book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. Keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low " effective demand " and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. The term "revolutionary" has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis. [ ] 
 Keynesian economics has two successors. Post-Keynesian economics also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. Research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. It is generally associated with the University of Cambridge and the work of Joan Robinson . [ ] 
 New-Keynesian economics is also associated with developments in the Keynesian fashion. Within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard Keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. These are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older Keynesian-style ones. 
 Chicago school of economics 
 The Chicago School of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. According to Milton Friedman and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. Ben Bernanke , former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting Friedmans analysis of the causes of the Great Depression. [ ] 
 Milton Friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by Adam Smith and the classical economists and modernized them. One example of this is his article in the September   issue of The New York Times Magazine, where he claims that the social responsibility of business should be "to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits ... (through) open and free competition without deception or fraud." [ ] 
 Other schools and approaches 
 Other well-known schools or trends of thought referring to a particular style of economics practised at and disseminated from well-defined groups of academicians that have become known worldwide, include the Austrian School , the Freiburg School , the School of Lausanne , post-Keynesian economics and the Stockholm school . Contemporary mainstream economics is sometimes separated into the Saltwater approach of those universities along the Eastern and Western coasts of the US, and the Freshwater, or Chicago-school approach. 
 Agreements 
 According to various polls cited in Principles of Economics by Harvard Chairman and Economics Professor Gregory Mankiw , economists have the following agreements by percentage. [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] 
 A ceiling on rents reduces the quantity and quality of housing available. ( % agree) 
 The United States should not restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries. ( % agree) 
 Economic growth in developed countries like the United States leads to greater levels of well-being. ( % agree) 
 An appropriately designed fiscal policy can increase the long-run rate of capital formation . ( % agree) 
 Cash payments increase the welfare of recipients to a greater degree than do transfers-in-kind of equal cash value. ( % agree) 
 The redistribution of income in the United States is a legitimate role for the government. ( % agree) 
 A minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers. ( % agree) 
 The government should restructure the welfare system along the lines of a “ negative income tax .” ( % agree) 
 Government subsidies on ethanol in the United States should be reduced or eliminated. ( % agree) 
 Criticisms 
 General criticisms 
 " The dismal science " is a derogatory alternative name for economics devised by the Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle in the  th century. It is often stated that Carlyle gave economics the nickname "the dismal science" as a response to the late  th century writings of The Reverend Thomas Robert Malthus , who grimly predicted that starvation would result, as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply. However, the actual phrase was coined by Carlyle in the context of a debate with John Stuart Mill on slavery , in which Carlyle argued for slavery, while Mill opposed it. [ ] 
 Some economists, like John Stuart Mill or Léon Walras , have maintained that the production of wealth should not be tied to its distribution. [ ] 
 In The Wealth of Nations , Adam Smith addressed many issues that are currently also the subject of debate and dispute. Smith repeatedly attacks groups of politically aligned individuals who attempt to use their collective influence to manipulate a government into doing their bidding. In Smiths day, these were referred to as factions , but are now more commonly called special interests , a term which can comprise international bankers, corporate conglomerations, outright oligopolies , monopolies , trade unions and other groups. [ ] 
 Economics per se, as a social science, is independent of the political acts of any government or other decision-making organization, however, many policymakers or individuals holding highly ranked positions that can influence other peoples lives are known for arbitrarily using a plethora of economic concepts and rhetoric as vehicles to legitimize agendas and value systems , and do not limit their remarks to matters relevant to their responsibilities. [ ] The close relation of economic theory and practice with politics [ ] is a focus of contention that may shade or distort the most unpretentious original tenets of economics, and is often confused with specific social agendas and value systems. [ ] 
 Notwithstanding, economics legitimately has a role in informing government policy. It is, indeed, in some ways an outgrowth of the older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals are currently focusing increased efforts on gauging the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Currently, there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in a recent survey of American Economic Association economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting. [ ] 
 In Steady State Economics  , leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly argues that there exist logical inconsistencies between the emphasis placed on economic growth and the limited availability of natural resources. [ ] 
 Deirdre McCloskey has argued that many empirical economic studies are poorly reported, and she and Stephen Ziliak argue that although her critique has been well-received, practice has not improved. [ ] This latter contention is controversial. [ ] 
 A   International Monetary Fund study looked at "consensus forecasts" (the forecasts of large groups of economists) that were made in advance of   different national recessions in the  s: in  % of the cases the economists did not predict the contraction a year in advance. On those rare occasions when economists did successfully predict recessions, they significantly underestimated their severity. [ ] 
 Nevertheless, prominent mainstream economists such as Keynes [ ] and Joskow have observed that much of economics is conceptual rather than quantitative, and difficult to model and formalize quantitatively. In a discussion on oligopoly research, Paul Joskow pointed out in   that in practice, serious students of actual economies tended to use "informal models" based upon qualitative factors specific to particular industries. Joskow had a strong feeling that the important work in oligopoly was done through informal observations while formal models were "trotted out ex post ". He argued that formal models were largely not important in the empirical work, either, and that the fundamental factor behind the theory of the firm, behaviour, was neglected. [ ] 
 In recent years, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of feminist economics . [ ] Contrary to common conceptions of economics as a positive and objective science, feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics [ ] and highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. Primary criticisms focus on failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors ( homo economicus ); exogenous tastes; the impossibility of utility comparisons; the exclusion of unpaid work; and the exclusion of class and gender considerations. Feminist economics developed to address these concerns, and the field now includes critical examinations of many areas of economics including paid and unpaid work, economic epistemology and history, globalization, household economics and the care economy. In  , Marilyn Waring published the book If Women Counted , in which she argues that the discipline of economics ignores womens unpaid work and the value of nature ; [ ] according to Julie A. Nelson , If Women Counted "showed exactly how the unpaid work traditionally done by women has been made invisible within national accounting systems " and "issued a wake-up call to issues of ecological sustainability ." [ ] Bjørnholt and McKay argue that the financial crisis of  –  and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories that fully acknowledge care for each other as well as the planet. [ ] 
 The imperatives of the orthodox research programme [of economic science] leave little room for maneuver and less room for originality. ... These mandates ... Appropriate as many mathematical techniques and metaphorical expressions from contemporary respectable science, primarily physics as possible. ... Preserve to the maximum extent possible the attendant nineteenth-century overtones of "natural order" ... Deny strenuously that neoclassical theory slavishly imitates physics. ... Above all, prevent all rival research programmes from encroaching ... by ridiculing all external attempts to appropriate twentieth century physics models. ... All theorizing is [in this way] held hostage to nineteenth-century concepts of energy. [ ] 
 In a series of peer-reviewed journal and conference papers and books published over a period of several decades, John McMurtry [ ] has provided extensive criticism of what he terms the "unexamined assumptions and implications [of economics], and their consequent cost to peoples lives." [ ] 
 Nassim Nicholas Taleb and Michael Perelman are two additional scholars who criticized conventional or mainstream economics. Taleb opposes most economic theorizing, which in his view suffers acutely from the problem of overuse of Platos Theory of Forms , and calls for cancellation of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics , saying that the damage from economic theories can be devastating. [ ] [ ] Michael Perelman provides extensive criticism of economics and its assumptions in all his books (and especially his books published from   to date), papers and interviews. 
 Despite these concerns, mainstream graduate programs have become increasingly technical and mathematical. [ ] [ ]
